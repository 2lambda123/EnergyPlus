<h3 id="one-two-and-variable-speed-cooling-towers-and-evaporative-fluid-coolers">One, Two, and Variable Speed Cooling Towers and Evaporative Fluid Coolers</h3>
<h4 id="overview">Overview</h4>
<p>The input objects CoolingTower:SingleSpeed, CoolingTower:TwoSpeed, and CoolingTower:VariableSpeed:Merkel provide models for single-speed, two-speed, and variable-speed cooling towers that are based on Merkel’s theory (Merkel 1925), which is also the basis for the tower model included in ASHRAE’s HVAC1 Toolkit for primary HVAC system energy calculations (ASHRAE 1999, Bourdouxhe et al. 1994). Cooling tower performance is modeled using effectiveness-NTU relationships for counterflow heat exchangers. The model can be used to simulate the performance of both single speed, two speed, and variable speed mechanical-draft cooling towers. The model will also account for tower performance in the “free convection” regime, when the tower fan is off but the water pump remains on. For part-load operation, the model assumes a simple linear interpolation between two steady-state regimes without accounting for any cycling losses.</p>
<p>For single speed cooling towers, the capacity control can be fan cycling or fluid bypass. In fluid bypass mode, portion of the water goes through the tower media and gets cooled while the remaining water flow gets bypassed, two water flows then mix together trying to meet the tower exiting water setpoint temperature. In both the free convection cooling when fan is off and normal cooling when fan is on for the entire time step, if the tower exiting water temperature is lower than the setpoint, the tower operates in fluid bypass mode. The model determines the fluid bypass fraction by iterations until the mixed water meets the tower exiting water temperature setpoint. In the fluid bypass mode, except the free convection, the tower fan runs at full speed for the entire time step. The maximum amount of tower water that can be bypassed is bounded by the freezing point of the tower water – the tower exiting water temperature cannot be lower than the freezing setpoint.</p>
<p>Evaporative fluid coolers are modeled very similar to cooling towers. The main difference between the two is in the “Performance input method” input field. Cooling tower has two choices for this field namely “UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate” and “Nominal capacity”. The nominal capacity is specified for the standard conditions i.e. entering water at 35C (95F), leaving water at 29.44C (85F), entering air at 25.56C (78F) wet-bulb temperature and 35C (95F) dry-bulb temperature. On the other hand evaporative fluid cooler has three choices for “Performance input method” which are “UFactorTimesAreaAndDesignWaterFlowRate”, “StandardDesignCapacity” and “UserSpecifiedDesignCapacity”. First method is same for both tower and fluid cooler. Standard design capacity is specified for the same conditions which are used to specify nominal capacity for tower as described above. If the capacity of fluid cooler for conditions other than the standard ones is known then UserSpecifiedDesignCapacity method should be used. In this case, the conditions for which the fluid cooler capacity is known i.e. entering water temperature, entering air temperature and entering air wet bulb temperature must be specified in the input. To calculate evaporation loss for fluid cooler, spray water flow rate which is different than the process fluid flow rate must be specified for all the performance input methods. This is not required for cooling tower because cooled fluid i.e. water is in direct contact with the air so the water loss is calculated by using cooled fluid flow rate only. Unlike cooling tower, evaporative fluid cooler model does not account for free convection.</p>
<p>Cooling tower model is described below which holds equally good for evaporative fluid cooler. The differences are mentioned whenever required.</p>
<h4 id="model-description">Model Description</h4>
<p>Based on Merkel’s theory, the steady-state total heat transfer between the air and water entering the tower can be defined by the following equation:</p>
<div>\[d{\dot Q_{total}} = \frac{{UdA}}{{cp}}\left( {{h_s} - {h_a}} \right)\]</div>

<p>where</p>
<p><em>h<sub>s</sub></em> = enthalpy of saturated air at the wetted-surface temperature, J/kg</p>
<p><em>h<sub>a</sub></em> = enthalpy of air in the free stream, J/kg</p>
<p><em>c<sub>p</sub></em> = specific heat of moist air, J/kg-<sup>o</sup>C</p>
<p><em>U</em> = cooling tower overall heat transfer coefficient, W/m<sup>2</sup>- <sup>o</sup>C</p>
<p><em>A</em> = heat transfer surface area, m<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>Equation is based on several assumptions:</p>
<p>n air and water vapor behave as ideal gases</p>
<p>n the effect of water evaporation is neglected</p>
<p>n fan heat is neglected</p>
<p>n the interfacial air film is assumed to be saturated</p>
<p>n the Lewis number is equal to 1</p>
<p>In this model, it is also assumed that the moist air enthalpy is solely a function of the wet-bulb temperature and that the moist air can be treated as an equivalent ideal gas with its mean specific heat defined by the following equation:</p>
<div>\[\bar cpe = \frac{{\Delta h}}{{\Delta {T_{wb}}}}\]</div>

<p>where</p>
<p>Δ<em>h</em> = enthalpy difference between the air entering and leaving the tower, J/kg</p>
<p>Δ<em>T<sub>wb</sub></em>= wet-bulb temperature difference between the air entering and leaving the tower, <sup>o</sup>C</p>
<p>Since the liquid side conductance is much greater than the gas side conductance, the wetted-surface temperature is assumed to be equal to the water temperature. Based on this assumption and equations and , the expression for total heat transfer becomes:</p>
<div>\[d{\dot Q_{total}} = UedA\left( {{T_w} - {T_{wb}}} \right)\]</div>

<p>where</p>
<div>\[Ue = \frac{{U\,\bar cpe}}{{cp}}\]</div>

<p><em>T<sub>wb</sub></em> = wet-bulb temperature of the air, <sup>o</sup>C</p>
<p><em>T<sub>w</sub></em> = temperature of the water, <sup>o</sup>C</p>
<p>An energy balance on the water and air sides of the air/water interface yields the following equations:</p>
<div>\[d{\dot Q_{total}} = {\dot m_w}cpw\,\,\,dTw\]</div>

<div>\[d{\dot Q_{total}} = {\dot m_a}\bar cpe\,\,\,dTwb\]</div>

<p>where</p>
<div img="image4534.txt">\({\dot m_w}\)</div>

<p>= mass flow rate of water, kg/s</p>
<div img="image4535.txt">\({\dot m_a}\)</div>

<p>= mass flow rate of air, kg/s</p>
<p>Assuming that the heat capacity rate (<div img="image4536.txt">(\dot mcp)</div>) for the cooling tower water is less than that for the air,the effectiveness of the cooling tower can be defined by analogy to the effectiveness of a simple heat exchanger:</p>
<div>\[\varepsilon  = \frac{{{T_{win}} - {T_{wout}}}}{{{T_{win}} - {T_{wbin}}}}\]</div>

<p>where</p>
<p><em>ε</em> = heat exchanger effectiveness</p>
<p><em>T<sub>win</sub></em> = inlet water temperature, <sup>o</sup>C</p>
<p><em>T<sub>wout</sub></em> = outlet water temperature, <sup>o</sup>C</p>
<p><em>T<sub>wbin</sub></em> = wet-bulb temperature of the inlet air, <sup>o</sup>C</p>
<p>Combining equations , , and and integrating over the entire heat transfer surface area, and combining the result with equation provides the following expression for cooling tower effectiveness:</p>
<div>\[\varepsilon \,\, = \,\frac{{1 - \exp \left\{ { - NTU\left[ {1 - \left( {\frac{{{{\dot C}_w}}}{{{{\dot C}_a}}}} \right)} \right]} \right\}}}{{1 - \left( {\frac{{{{\dot C}_w}}}{{{{\dot C}_a}}}} \right)\exp \left\{ { - NTU\left[ {1 - \left( {\frac{{{{\dot C}_w}}}{{{{\dot C}_a}}}} \right)} \right]} \right\}}}\]</div>

<p>where</p>
<div img="image4539.txt">\({\dot C_w} = {\dot m_w}c{p_w}\)</div>

<p>and <div img="image4540.txt">({\dot C_a} = {\dot m_a}\bar c{p_e})</div></p>
<div>\[NTU = Number\,of\,Transfer\,Units = \frac{{UAe}}{{{{\dot C}_w}}}\]</div>

<p>This equation is identical to the expression for effectiveness of an indirect contact (i.e., fluids separated by a solid wall) counterflow heat exchanger (Incropera and DeWitt 1981). Therefore, the cooling tower can be modeled, in the steady-state regime, by an equivalent counterflow heat exchanger as shown in the following figure.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../EngineeringReference/media/image4542.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 194. Cooling Tower Schematic</p>
<p>The first fluid is water and the second fluid is an equivalent fluid entering the heat exchanger at temperature T<sub>wbin</sub> and specific heat <div img="image4543.txt">(\bar cpe)</div>. The heat exchanger is characterized by a single parameter, its overall heat transfer coefficient-area product UA<sub>e</sub>. The actual cooling tower heat transfer coefficient-area product is related to UA<sub>e</sub> by the following expression:</p>
<div>\[UA = UAe\frac{{cp}}{{\bar cpe}}\]</div>

<p>This heat transfer coefficient-area product is assumed to be a function of the air mass flow rate only and can be estimated from laboratory test results or manufacturers’ catalog data.</p>
<p>The model for the variable speed Merkel tower also includes Scheier’s modifications.  Scheier has extended the Merkel model to also include terms that adjust UA with three factors that model how UA values change when the tower is operating away from its rated conditions.  The first factor, <div img="image4545.txt">({f_{UA,wetbulb}})</div>, adjusts UA for the current outdoor wetbulb temperature.  The user enters a performance curve or lookup table that is a function of one independent variable.  The independent variable is the difference between the design wetbulb temperature and the current wetbulb temperature, in degrees Celsius.</p>
<div>\[{f_{UA,wetbulb}} = func\left( {\left( {{T_{des,wetbulb}} - {T_{current,wetbulb}}} \right)} \right)\]</div>

<p>The second factor, <div img="image4547.txt">({f_{UA,airflow}})</div>, adjusts UA for the current air flow rate.  The user enters a performance curve or lookup table that is a function of one independent variable.  The independent variable is the ratio of the current air flow rate to the design air flow rate at full speed.</p>

<h4 id="method-for-calculating-steady-state-exiting-water-temperature">Method for Calculating Steady-State Exiting Water Temperature</h4>
<p>The objective of the cooling tower model is to predict the exiting water temperature and the fan power required to meet the exiting water setpoint temperature. Since only the inlet air and inlet water temperatures are known at any simulation time step, an iterative procedure is required to determine the exiting fluid temperatures using the equations defined in the previous section. In the case of the EnergyPlus model, the iterations are performed to determine the exiting wet-bulb temperature of the air. The exiting water temperature is then calculated based on an energy balance that assumes that the energy absorbed by the air is equivalent to the energy removed from the water. The procedure for calculating the steady-state, exiting air wet-bulb temperature is outlined below.</p>
<p>As explained previously, it is assumed that the moist air enthalpy can be defined by the wet-bulb temperature alone. Therefore, the first step in the procedure is to calculate the enthalpy of moist air entering the cooling tower based on the ambient wet-bulb temperature from the weather file. Since an iterative solution is required, a first guess of the outlet air wet-bulb temperature is then made and the enthalpy of this estimated outlet air wet-bulb temperature is calculated. Based on these inlet and outlet air conditions, the mean specific heat of the air is calculated based on equation , repeated here:</p>
<div>\[\bar cpe = \frac{{\Delta h}}{{\Delta Twb}}\]</div>

<p>With the overall heat transfer coefficient-area product for the cooling tower entered by the user, the effective heat transfer coefficient-area product is calculated by rearranging equation :</p>
<div>\[UAe = UA\frac{{\bar cpe}}{{cp}}\]</div>

<p>With <div img="image4554.txt">(\bar cpe)</div> and <div img="image4555.txt">(UAe)</div> known, the effectiveness of the heat exchanger is then calculated:</p>
<div>\[\varepsilon \,\, = \,\frac{{1 - \exp \left\{ { - NTU\left[ {1 - \left( {\frac{{{{\dot C}_{\min }}}}{{{{\dot C}_{\max }}}}} \right)} \right]} \right\}}}{{1 - \left( {\frac{{{{\dot C}_{\min }}}}{{{{\dot C}_{\max }}}}} \right)\exp \left\{ { - NTU\left[ {1 - \left( {\frac{{{{\dot C}_{\min }}}}{{{{\dot C}_{\max }}}}} \right)} \right]} \right\}}}\]</div>

<p>where</p>
<div img="image4557.txt">\({\dot C_{\min }} = \,Minimum\,({\dot C_w},\,{\dot C_a})\)</div>

<p>and <div img="image4558.txt">({\dot C_{\max }} = \,Maximum\,({\dot C_w},\,{\dot C_a}))</div></p>
<div img="image4559.txt">\({\dot C_w} = {\dot m_w}c{p_w}\)</div>

<p>and <div img="image4560.txt">({\dot C_a} = {\dot m_a}\bar cpe)</div></p>
<div>\[NTU = Number\,of\,Transfer\,Units = \frac{{UAe}}{{{{\dot C}_{\min }}}}\]</div>

<p>The heat transfer rate is then calculated as follows:</p>
<div>\[\dot Qtotal = \,\varepsilon \,{\dot C_{\min }}\left( {Twin\, - \,Twbin} \right)\]</div>

<p>The outlet air wet-bulb temperature is then recalculated:</p>
<div>\[{T_{wbout}} = {T_{wbin}} + \frac{{{{\dot Q}_{total}}}}{{{{\dot C}_a}}}\]</div>

<p>The iterative process of calculating <div img="image4564.txt">({T_{wbout}})</div> continues until convergence is reached.</p>
<p>Finally, the outlet water temperature is calculated as follows:</p>
<div>\[{T_{wout}} = {T_{win}} + \frac{{{{\dot Q}_{total}}}}{{{{\dot C}_w}}}\]</div>

<h4 id="calculating-the-actual-exiting-water-temperature-and-fan-power">Calculating the Actual Exiting Water Temperature and Fan Power</h4>
<p>The previous section describes the methodology used for calculating the steady-state temperature of the water leaving the cooling tower. This methodology is used to calculate the exiting water temperature in the free convection regime (water pump on, tower fan off) and with the tower fan operating (including low and high fan speed for the two-speed tower). The exiting water temperature calculations use the fluid flow rates (water and air) and the UA-values entered by the user for each regime.</p>
<p>The cooling tower model seeks to maintain the temperature of the water exiting the cooling tower at (or below) a setpoint. The model obtains the target temperature setpoint from the setpoints placed on either the tower outlet node or the loop’s overall setpoint node (typically set to the supply side outlet node). The model checks to see if the outlet node has a setpoint placed on it and uses that if it does.  If the outlet node does not have a temperature setpoint then the model uses the loop-level outlet node specified in the input field called Loop Temperature Setpoint Node Name in the PlantLoop or CondenserLoop object. The model first checks to determine the impact of “free convection”, if specified by the user, on the tower exiting water temperature. If free convection is not specified by the user, then the exiting water temperature is initially set equal to the entering tower water temperature. If the user specifies “free convection” and the steady-state exiting water temperature based on “free convection” is at or below the setpoint, then the tower fan is not turned on.</p>
<p>If the exiting water temperature remains above the setpoint after “free convection” is modeled, then the tower fan is turned on to reduce the exiting water temperature to the setpoint. The model assumes that part-load operation is represented by a simple linear interpolation between two steady-state regimes (e.g., tower fan on for the entire simulation time step and tower fan off for the entire simulation time step). Cyclic losses are not taken into account.</p>
<p>The fraction of time that the tower fan must operate is calculated based on the following equation:</p>
<div>\[\omega \,\, = \frac{{{T_{set}} - {T_{wout,off}}}}{{{T_{wout,on}} - {T_{wout,off}}}}\]</div>

<p>where</p>
<div img="image4567.txt">\({T_{set}}\)</div>

<p>= exiting water setpoint temperature, <sup>o</sup>C</p>
<div img="image4568.txt">\({T_{wout,off}}\)</div>

<p>= exiting water temperature with tower fan off, <sup>o</sup>C</p>
<div img="image4569.txt">\({T_{wout,on}}\)</div>

<p>= exiting water temperature with tower fan on, <sup>o</sup>C</p>
<p>The average fan power for the simulation time step is calculated by multiplying <div img="image4570.txt">(\omega \,)</div>by the steady-state fan power specified by the user.</p>
<p>The calculation method for the two-speed tower is similar to that for the single-speed tower example described above. The model first checks to see if “free convection” is specified and if the resulting exiting water temperature is below the setpoint temperature. If not, then the model calculates the steady-state exiting water temperature with the tower fan at low speed. If the exiting water temperature at low fan speed is below the setpoint temperature, then the average fan power is calculated based on the result of equation and the steady-state, low speed fan power specified by the user. If low-speed fan operation is unable to reduce the exiting water temperature below the setpoint, then the tower fan is increased to its high speed and the steady-state exiting water temperature is calculated. If this temperature is below the setpoint, then a modified version of equation is used to calculate runtime at high fan speed:</p>
<div>\[\omega \,\, = \frac{{{T_{set}} - {T_{wout,low}}}}{{{T_{wout,high}} - {T_{wout,low}}}}\]</div>

<p>where</p>
<div img="image4572.txt">\({T_{set}}\)</div>

<p>= exiting water setpoint temperature, <sup>o</sup>C</p>
<div img="image4573.txt">\({T_{wout,low}}\)</div>

<p>= exiting water temperature with tower fan at low speed, <sup>o</sup>C</p>
<div img="image4574.txt">\({T_{wout,high}}\)</div>

<p>= exiting water temperature with tower fan at high speed, <sup>o</sup>C</p>
<p>The average fan power for the simulation time step is calculated for the two-speed cooling tower as follows:</p>
<div>\[{P_{fan,avg}}\, = \,\omega \,({P_{fan,high}})\, + \,\left( {1 - \omega } \right)\left( {{P_{fan,low}}} \right)\]</div>

<p>The calculation method for the variable-speed Merkel/Scheier model is different from the one- and two-speed models.  Whereas the other towers are setpoint driven, the variable speed Merkel/Scheier model is driven by the load dispatched from the plant operation scheme, such as PlantEquipmentOperation:CoolingLoad.  The plant operation scheme provides the cooling tower model with a target load to meet and the tower is controlled to meet that load (as opposed to meeting a leaving setpoint).  This allows complex configurations with more than one cooling tower to be properly dispatched using all the features available in the various plant operation schemes.  The model first evaluates the load provided with the fans off using only free convection.  If the free convection mode meets or exceeds the target load then the tower runs in free convection mode.  The model then evaluates the load provided by running the fans at full speed.  If the full fan speed load provided is less than or equal to the target load then the tower runs at full speed.  The model then evaluates the load provided with the variable speed fan running at the minimum air speed ratio, which is a user input (default is 0.2).  If the minimum fan speed load provided meets or exceeds the target load, then tower runs at the minimum fan speed.  If the target load is between the load provided by minimum and maximum fans speeds, then the model solves for an airflow rate ratio that just meets the target load using Regula Falsi numerical method.  The variable speed Merkel/Scheier model does not model bypass and may provided excess cooling at times when running in free convection or at the minimum fan speed.  Fan power for the variable speed Merkel/Scheier model is then calculated from the airflow rate ratio using a design fan power and a performance curve or lookup table with one independent variable for the airflow ratio.</p>

<h3 id="variable-speed-cooling-towers-empirical-models">Variable Speed Cooling Towers Empirical Models</h3>
<h4 id="overview_1">Overview</h4>
<p>The input object CoolingTower:VariableSpeed provides models for variable speed towers that are based on empirical curve fits of manufacturer’s performance data or field measurements. The user specifies tower performance at design conditions, and empirical curves are used to determine the approach temperature and fan power at off-design conditions. The user defines tower performance by entering the inlet air wet-bulb temperature, tower range, and tower approach temperature at the design conditions. The corresponding water flow rate, air flow rate, and fan power must also be specified. The model will account for tower performance in the “free convection” regime, when the tower fan is off but the water pump remains on and heat transfer still occurs (albeit at a low level). Basin heater operation and makeup water usage (due to evaporation, drift, and blowdown) are also modeled.</p>
<p>The cooling tower seeks to maintain the temperature of the water exiting the cooling tower at (or below) a setpoint. The setpoint temperature is defined by the setpoints placed on either the tower outlet node or the loop’s overall setpoint node (typically set to the supply side outlet node). The model checks to see if the outlet node has a setpoint placed on it and uses that if it does.  If the outlet node does not have a temperature setpoint then the model uses the loop-level outlet node specified in the input field called Loop Temperature Setpoint Node Name in the PlantLoop or CondenserLoop object. The model simulates the outlet water temperature in four successive steps:</p>
<p>·        The model first determines the tower outlet water temperature with the tower fan operating at maximum speed. If the outlet water temperature is above the setpoint temperature, the fan runs at maximum speed.</p>
<p>·        If the outlet water temperature with maximum fan speed is below the setpoint temperature, then the model next determines the impact of “free convection” (water flowing through tower with fan off). If the exiting water temperature based on “free convection” is at or below the setpoint, then the tower fan is not turned on.</p>
<p>·        If the outlet water temperature remains above the setpoint after “free convection” is modeled, then the tower fan is turned on at the minimum fan speed (minimum air flow rate ratio) to reduce the leaving water temperature. If the outlet water temperature is below the setpoint at minimum fan speed, the tower fan is cycled on and off to maintain the outlet water setpoint temperature.</p>
<p>·        If the outlet water temperature remains above the setpoint after minimum fan speed is modeled, then the tower fan is turned on and the model determines the required air flow rate and corresponding fan speed to meet the desired setpoint temperature.</p>
<h4 id="model-description_1">Model Description</h4>
<p>The variable speed tower model utilizes user-defined tower performance at design conditions along with empirical curves to determine tower heat rejection and fan power at off-design conditions. Basin heater operation and makeup water usage are also modeled based on user inputs, tower entering air conditions, and tower operation. The following sections describe how each of these tower performance areas is modeled.</p>
<h4 id="tower-heat-rejection">Tower Heat Rejection</h4>
<p>Heat rejection by the variable speed cooling tower is modeled based on the CoolTools correlation, YorkCalc correlation, or user-defined coefficients for either the CoolTools or YorkCalc correlations. These purely-empirical correlations model the tower approach temperature using a polynomial curve fit with a large number of terms and either three or four independent variables.</p>
<p>The CoolTools correlation has 35 terms with four independent variables:</p>

<p>If the user selects Tower Model Type = YorkCalc, then the 27 coefficients derived for the YorkCalc simulation model (York International Corp. 2002) are used and these coefficients are already defined within EnergyPlus as shown in Table 63. If the user specifies Tower Model Type = YorkCalcUserDefined, then the user must enter a CoolingTowerPerformance:YorkCalc object to define the 27 coefficients that will be used by the YorkCalc approach temperature correlation.</p>
<p>The approach temperature correlations for the CoolTools and YorkCalc simulation models are valid for a range of conditions defined in Table 64. If the user defines their own model coefficients (CoolingTowerPerformance:CoolTools or CoolingTowerPerformance:YorkCalc), then they must also define in that same object the range of conditions for which the model is valid. For all of these correlation variables, the program issues warnings if the actual values are beyond the minimum/maximum values specified for the correlation being used. For inlet air wet-bulb temperature and water mass flow rate ratio, the values of these variables used in the calculation of approach temperature are limited to be within the valid minimum/maximum range. For approach, range, and liquid-to-gas ratio the warnings are issued if the values are beyond the specified minimum/maximum range but the actual values are still used. The warnings issued do not necessarily indicate a poor estimate of tower performance at the condition(s) which caused the warning, but are provided to identify conditions outside the defined correlation limits. Exceeding the defined limits by a small amount may not introduce significant errors, but large deviations may be problematic. It is for this reason that we recommend using a very broad range of cooling tower performance data (i.e., data covering the entire range expected during the simulation) when generating user-defined coefficients for the variable speed tower model.</p>

<p>The approach temperature correlation(s) used to simulate cooling tower heat rejection are based on water and air flow rate “ratios” and are not directly dependent on the size of the tower or the actual air and water flow rates through the tower. However, the model correlations are developed based on a reference condition. For Model Types “CoolToolsCrossFlow” and “YorkCalc”, the reference condition is a water flow rate of 0.000043 m<sup>3</sup>/s per kW of heat rejected (2.4 gal/min per ton of heat rejected) with 25.6<sup>o</sup>C (78<sup>o</sup>F) enter air wet-bulb temperature, 35<sup>o</sup>C (95<sup>o</sup>F) hot water inlet temperature, and 29.4<sup>o</sup>C (85<sup>o</sup>F) cold water outlet temperature. The reference condition may be different if the user defines tower model coefficients using CoolingTowerPerformance:CoolTools or CoolingTowerPerformance:YorkCalc.</p>
<p>Due to the inherent reference condition used to generate the tower performance curves, the water flow rate at the reference condition must be determined using the design performance information specified by the user and the tower model’s approach temperature correlation. This is done by using the model’s approach temperature correlation (described earlier in this section) to calculate the water flow rate ratio which yields the user-defined design approach temperature based on an air flow rate ratio of 1.0 (<em>FR<sub>air</sub></em> = 1.0), the design inlet air wet-bulb temperature, and the design range temperature. The calculated approach temperature (using the model correlation) must satisfy the following two equations:</p>
<div img="image4577.txt">\({T_{water,outlet,design}} = {T_{wb,air,design}} + {T_{approach,design}}\quad \{ F{R_{air}} = 1.0\} \)</div>

<div img="image4578.txt">\({T_{water,inlet,design}} = {T_{wb,air,design}} + {T_{approach,design}} + {T_{range,design}}\quad \{ F{R_{air}} = 1.0\} \)</div>

<p>= air flow rate ratio (actual air flow rate divided by design air flow rate)</p>
<p>The water flow rate ratio used in the approach temperature correlation which satisfies these two equations is the ratio of the design water flow rate (specified by the user) to the water flow rate at the reference condition. This ratio is used to calculate the reference water volumetric flow rate, which is then used throughout the simulation to determine the actual water flow rate ratio used in the approach temperature correlation for each simulation time step.</p>

<p>The cooling tower seeks to maintain the temperature of the water exiting the cooling tower at (or below) a setpoint. The setpoint temperature is defined by the field “Condenser Loop Temperature Setpoint schedule or reference” for the CondenserLoop object. The model simulates the outlet water temperature in four successive steps:</p>
<p>·        The model first determines the tower outlet water temperature with the tower fan operating at maximum speed. If the outlet water temperature is above the setpoint temperature, the fan runs at maximum speed.</p>
<p>·        If the outlet water temperature with maximum fan speed is below the setpoint temperature, then the model next determines the impact of “free convection” (water flowing through tower with fan off). If the exiting water temperature based on “free convection” is at or below the setpoint, then the tower fan is not turned on.</p>
<p>·        If the outlet water temperature remains above the setpoint after “free convection” is modeled, then the tower fan is turned on at the minimum fan speed (minimum air flow rate ratio) to reduce the leaving water temperature. If the outlet water temperature is below the setpoint at minimum fan speed, the tower fan is cycled on and off to maintain the outlet water setpoint temperature.</p>
<p>·        If the outlet water temperature remains above the setpoint after minimum fan speed is modeled, then the tower fan is turned on and the model determines the required air flow rate and corresponding fan speed to meet the desired setpoint temperature.</p>
<p>For each simulation time step, the model first calculates the outlet water temperature with the tower fan operating at maximum speed (FRair = 1.0). The calculated approach temperature (using the correlations described above), inlet air wet-bulb temperature (weather data), and range temperature are used to determine the tower outlet water temperature as follows:</p>
<div>\[\begin{array}{l}{T_{water,outlet,fanMAX}} = {T_{wb,air}} + \,\,{T_{approach}}\,\,\,\,\,\{ F{R_{air}} = 1.0\} \\\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\quad \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, = \,{T_{water,inlet}}\, + \,\,{T_{range}}\end{array}\]</div>

<p>= approach temperature at current operating conditions (<sup>o</sup>C)</p>
<div img="image4593.txt">\({T_{range}}\)</div>

<p>= range temperature at current operating conditions (<sup>o</sup>C)</p>
<p>Note that the approach temperature correlation as described previously is a function of range temperature, so the equations above must be solved iteratively to converge on a solution. If the resulting outlet water temperature is above the desired setpoint temperature, then the fan runs at maximum speed and does not cycle on/off (fan part-load ratio = FanPLR = 1.0 and <em>FR<sub>air</sub></em> = 1.0).</p>
<p>If the outlet water temperature with maximum fan speed is below the setpoint temperature, then the model next determines the impact of “free convection” (water flowing through tower with fan off). In the free convection regime, the outlet water temperature is calculated using a fraction of the water temperature difference through the tower when the fan is at its maximum speed. This fraction is defined by the user (Fraction of Tower Capacity in Free Convection Regime).</p>
<div>\[{T_{water,outlet,fanOFF}} = {T_{water,inlet}}\,\,\,\, - \,\,\left[ {Fra{c_{freeconv}}\left( {{T_{water,inlet}}\,{\rm{ - }}\,\,{T_{water,outlet,fanMAX}}} \right)} \right]\]</div>

<p>When the cooling tower fan is operating, fan electric power is calculated based on the air flow rate ratio required to meet the above conditions. If the user has entered a fan power curve object (cubic curve), the output of that curve is multiplied by the design fan power. Otherwise, tower fan power is assumed to be directly proportional to the cube of the air flow rate ratio.

<p>Calculations are also made to estimate the electric power input to the tower basin heater.

If a schedule is not provided, the basin heater is assumed to be available the entire simulation time period. The basin heater operates when it is scheduled on, the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature is below the basin heater setpoint temperature, and the cooling tower is not active (i.e., water is not flowing through the tower).

<h3 id="cooling-towers-with-multiple-cells">Cooling Towers with Multiple Cells</h3>
<p>Many towers are constructed to be capable of being grouped together to achieve the desired capacity. Thus, many cooling towers are assemblies of two or more individual cooling towers or “cells.” The number of cells they have, e.g., an eight-cell tower, often refers to such towers.</p>
<p>For the operation of multi-cell towers, the first step is to determine the number of cells <em>n,</em> which will be operating during the timestep using the calculation logic from DOE-2.1E.</p>
<p>The maximum and minimum flow rates per cell are determined according to the input fractions (<em>Minimum  Water Flow Rate Fraction:</em><div img="image4623.txt">({k_{min}})</div><em> </em> and <em>Maximum  Water Flow Rate Fraction:</em> <div img="image4624.txt">({k_{max}})</div>) as follows:</p>
<div>\[\left\{ \begin{array}{ccccc}{{\dot m}_{w,min}} =  & \frac{{{{\dot m}_{w,des}}}}{{{n_{tot}}}} \times {k_{min}}\\\{{\dot m}_{w,max}} =  & \frac{{{{\dot m}_{w,des}}}}{{{n_{tot}}}} \times {k_{max}}\end{array} \right.\]</div>

<p>where <div img="image4626.txt">({{{\dot m}_{w,des}}})</div> is the design water flow rate through the entire cooling tower.</p>
<p>Then, we determine the minimum and maximum number of cells that can operate with this water flow rate:</p>
<div>\[\left\{ {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}{{n_{min}} = MIN\left( {\frac{{{{\dot m}_{w,tot}}}}{{{{\dot m}_{w,max}}}},{n_{tot}}} \right)}\\\{{n_{max}} = MIN\left( {\frac{{{{\dot m}_{w,tot}}}}{{{{\dot m}_{w,min}}}},{n_{tot}}} \right)}\end{array}} \right.\]</div>

<p>where <em>n<sub>tot</sub></em> is the total number of cells of the tower, and<div img="image4628.txt">({{{\dot m}_{w,tot}}})</div> is the water flow rate to the tower.</p>
<p>The number of cells operating<em>n</em> is set accordingly:</p>
<p>If the <em>Cell Control</em> method is <em>MinimalCell,</em></p>
<p><em>n =</em> <div img="image4629.txt">({{n_{min}}})</div></p>
<p>If the <em>Cell Control</em> method is <em>MaximalCell,</em></p>
<p><em>n =</em> <div img="image4630.txt">({{n_{max}}})</div></p>
<p>Finally, the water mass flow rate per cell (<div img="image4631.txt">({{\dot m}_w}))</div> will be:</p>
<div>\[{{\dot m}_w} = \frac{{{{\dot m}_{w,tot}}}}{n}\]</div>

<p>Then we simulate the performance of one cell with this flow rate per cell (calling the SimSimpleTower subroutine for single and two speed cooling tower objects). As we assume that each cell is identical, the UA of one cell is calculated dividing the UA of the whole tower (obtained from the input or from the auto sizing calculations). The air flow rate per cell is also equal to the one of the whole tower divided by the number of cells operating:</p>
<div>\[U{A_{cell}} = \frac{{U{A_{cell}}}}{{{n_{tot}}}}\]</div>

<div>\[{\dot m_{air,cell}} = \frac{{{{\dot m}_{air,tot}}}}{n}\]</div>

<p>At the end, the total fan power of the tower operating with a certain number of cells is given by:</p>
<div>\[FanPower = FanPowe{r_{tot}} \times \frac{n}{{{n_{tot}}}}\]</div>

<p>If the cells operating do not meet the loads, we increase the number of cells if spare cells are available and the water flow through each cell is within the user specified minimum and maximum water flow rate fractions range. This is an iteration process.</p>
<h3 id="cooling-tower-makeup-water-usage_1">Cooling Tower Makeup Water Usage</h3>
<p>Makeup water use for all types of cooling towers is made up of three components: evaporation, drift, and blowdown.  The first is the amount of water evaporated to reduce the water’s temperature as it passes through the cooling tower. There are two methods that evaporation makeup water can be modeled in EnergyPlus.  The first method assumes that the tower outlet air conditions are saturated (which may not always be the case for certain operating conditions).  For this “Saturated Exit” mode, the enthalpy of the tower’s outlet air is calculated as the inlet air enthalpy plus the water side heat transfer divided by the air mass flow rate through the tower.</p>

<p>The second method available for calculating water makeup for evaporation is for the user to provide a value for a loss factor.  The evaporation loss is then calculated as a fraction of the circulating condenser water flow and varies with the temperature change in the condenser water.  The value provided by the user is in units of percent-per-degree Kelvin.  The evaporation rate will equal this value times each degree Kelvin of temperature drop in the condenser water.  Typical values are from 0.15 to 0.27 [percent/K]. The default is 0.2.  The rate of water makeup for evaporation is then calculated by multiplying this factor times the condenser water flow rate and the temperature decrease in the condenser water flow rate. For evaporative fluid coolers, a numerical value of loss factor can be entered in the same manner as for cooling towers. If this field is blank, an empirical correlation will be used to calculate the value based on current outdoor dry bulb temperature and relative humidity. The following correlation from Qureshi and Zubair (2007) is used to calculate the loss factor:</p>
<div>\[Loss\;Factor = (113 - 8.417\phi  + 1.6147{t_{db}})*{10^{ - 5}}\]</div>

<p>Additional makeup water usage is modeled as a percentage of design water flow rate through the tower to account for drift, and as a scheduled flow rate to model blowdown. Drift is water loss due to the entrainment of small water droplets in the air stream passing through the tower. Drift is defined by the model user as a percentage of the tower’s design water flow rate, and is assumed to vary with tower air flow rate ratio as follows:</p>

<p>Blowdown is water flushed from the basin on a periodic basis to purge the concentration of mineral scale or other contaminants. There are two ways that blowdown is calculated in EnergyPlus.  Blowdown water rates can be scheduled so that we have:.</p>
<div>\[\begin{array}{l}IF\left( {Schedul{e_{blowdown}}\,is\,defined} \right)THEN\\\quad {{\dot V}_{blowdown,makeup}} = ScheduleValu{e_{blowdown}}\\ELSE\\\quad {{\dot V}_{blowdown,makeup}} = 0.0\\ENDIF\end{array}\]</div>

<p>The second (and default) way that blowdown can be calculated is to assume that blowdown water is continually introduced at a rate that will provide a constant concentration ratio.  As water evaporates it leaves behind minerals and the like causing the concentration of water impurities to be higher in the tower than in the makeup water.  Acceptable concentration ratios are in the range of 3 to 5 depending on the purity of the make up water.  Water lost as drift does not evaporate and decrease the water needed for blowdown.  Using the “Concentration Ratio” method, the rate of blowdown can be calculated using:</p>
<div>\[{\dot V_{blowdown,makeup}} = \frac{{{{\dot V}_{evaporation,makeup}}}}{{{R_{concentration}} - 1}} - {\dot V_{drift,makeup}}\]</div>

<p>The input objects FluidCooler:SingleSpeed and FluidCooler:TwoSpeed provide models for dry fluid coolers. Fluid cooler’s performance is modeled using effectiveness-NTU relationships for cross flow heat exchanger with both streams unmixed. The model can be used to simulate the performance of both single speed and two speed mechanical-draft fluid coolers. For part-load operation, the model assumes a simple linear interpolation between two steady-state regimes without accounting for any cycling losses.</p>
<h4 id="model-description_2">Model Description</h4>
<p>The expression for fluid cooler effectiveness is as follows:</p>

The heat exchanger is characterized by a single parameter, its overall heat transfer coefficient-area product UA.</p>
<p>When the user selects the nominal capacity method, the UA is calculated as follows:</p>
<p>The model inputs (other than the UA) and the fluid cooler load that it must meet are specified at design conditions. Then the fluid cooler model converges to a UA value, using the regulafalsi method that will enable it to meet the design fluid cooler load given at the specified inputs.</p>
<h4 id="method-for-calculating-steady-state-exiting-water-temperature_1">Method for Calculating Steady-State Exiting Water Temperature</h4>
<p>The objective of the fluid cooler model is to predict the exiting water temperature and the fan power required to meet the exiting water setpoint temperature. The exiting water temperature is calculated based on an energy balance that assumes that the energy absorbed by the air is equivalent to the energy removed from the water. The procedure for calculating the steady-state, exiting air dry-bulb temperature is outlined below.</p>
<p>With the overall heat transfer coefficient-area product for the fluid cooler calculated by the nominal capacity information entered by the user, the effectiveness of the heat exchanger is then calculated as:</p>
<div>\[\varepsilon  = 1 - {\mathop{\rm e}\nolimits} \left[ {{\raise0.7ex\hbox{${\{ {{\mathop{\rm e}\nolimits} ^{( - NTU{C_r}\eta )}} - 1\} }$} \!\mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{\{ {{\mathop{\rm e}\nolimits} ^{( - NTU{C_r}\eta )}} - 1\} } {{C_r}\eta }}}\right.}\!\lower0.7ex\hbox{${{C_r}\eta }$}}} \right]\]</div>

<p>The heat transfer rate is then calculated as follows:</p>
<div img="image4688.txt">\(\dot Q = \varepsilon {\dot C_{\min }}({T_{w,in}} - {T_{db,in}})\)</div>

<div img="image4689.txt">\(\dot Q = \varepsilon {\dot C_{\min }}({T_{w,in}} - {T_{db,in}})\)</div>

<p>Then the outlet air dry-bulb and outlet water temperature are calculated:</p>
<div>\[{T_{db,out}} = {T_{db,in}} + \frac{{\mathop Q\limits^. }}{{{{\mathop C\limits^. }_a}}}\]</div>

<div>\[{T_{w,out}} = {T_{w,in}} - \frac{{\mathop Q\limits^. }}{{{{\mathop C\limits^. }_w}}}\]</div>

<h4 id="calculating-the-actual-exiting-water-temperature-and-fan-power_1">Calculating the Actual Exiting Water Temperature and Fan Power</h4>
<p>The previous section describes the methodology used for calculating the steady-state temperature of the water leaving the fluid cooler. This methodology is used to calculate the exiting water temperature with the fluid cooler fans operating (including low and high fan speed for the two-speed fluid cooler). The exiting water temperature calculations use the fluid flow rates (water and air) and the Nominal capacity information entered by the user for each regime.</p>
<p>The fluid cooler model seeks to maintain the temperature of the water exiting the fluid cooler at (or below) a setpoint. The setpoint schedule is defined by the field “Loop Temperature Setpoint  Node or reference” for the CondenserLoop object.</p>
<p>The fluid cooler fans are turned on to reduce the exiting water temperature to the setpoint. The model assumes that part-load operation is represented by a simple linear interpolation between two steady-state regimes (e.g., Fluid cooler fans on for the entire simulation time step and fluid cooler fans off for the entire simulation time step). Cyclic losses are not taken into account. If the outlet water temperature is less than the set-point then the fraction of time for which the fluid cooler must operate to meet the set-point is calculated by using the following equation:</p>
<div>\[\omega \,\, = \frac{{{T_{set}} - {T_{wout,off}}}}{{{T_{wout,on}} - {T_{wout,off}}}}\]</div>

<p>Where</p>
<div img="image4697.txt">\({T_{set}}\)</div>

<p>= exiting water setpoint temperature, <sup>o</sup>C</p>
<div img="image4698.txt">\({T_{wout,off}}\)</div>

<div img="image4699.txt">\({T_{wout,on}}\)</div>

<p>= exiting water temperature with all fluid cooler fans on, <sup>o</sup>C</p>
<p>The average fan power for the simulation time step is calculated by multiplying <div img="image4700.txt">(\omega \,)</div>by the steady-state fan power specified by the user.</p>
<p>The calculation method for the two-speed fluid cooler is similar to that for the single-speed fluid cooler example described above. The model first calculates the steady-state exiting water temperature with the fluid cooler fans at low speed. If the exiting water temperature at low fan speed is below the setpoint temperature, then the average fan power is calculated based on the result of previous equation and the steady-state, low speed fan power specified by the user.  If low-speed fan operation is unable to reduce the exiting water temperature below the setpoint, then the fluid cooler fans’ speed is increased to high speed and the steady-state exiting water temperature is calculated. If this temperature is below the setpoint, then a modified version of previous equation is used to calculate runtime at high fan speed:</p>
<div>\[\omega \,\, = \frac{{{T_{set}} - {T_{wout,low}}}}{{{T_{wout,high}} - {T_{wout,low}}}}\]</div>

<p>The average fan power for the simulation time step is calculated for the two-speed fluid cooler as follows</p>
<div>\[{P_{fan,avg}}\, = \,\omega \,({P_{fan,high}})\, + \,\left( {1 - \omega } \right)\left( {{P_{fan,low}}} \right)\]</div>

<h2 id="demand-controlled-ventilation">Demand Controlled Ventilation <a name="DCV"></a></h2>
<p>ASHRAE Standard 62.1, Ventilation for Acceptable Indoor Air Quality, contains provisions that allow building ventilation systems to vary the amount of outdoor ventilation air delivered to occupied zones based on feedback from sensors that monitor various indoor air contaminants (ASHRAE 2007). Although not a contaminant of concern in most buildings, carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) levels can be monitored as an indicator of building occupancy and the associated human bioeffluent concentration. Demand controlled ventilation (DCV) is being increasingly used to modulate outdoor ventilation air based on real-time occupancy (Emmerich and Persily 1997, Schell et al. 1998, Schell and Int-Hout 2001). Modulating the outdoor ventilation air while maintaining proper indoor air quality has the potential for large energy savings compared to constant rate ventilation systems that are typically designed to provide outdoor ventilation air based on maximum anticipated occupancy.</p>
<p>EnergyPlus can model DCV by the ventilation rate procedure (VRP) defined in ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2007/2010 for single and multiple path systems, and the indoor air quality procedure (IAQP) defined in Standard 62. The VRP first calculates the breathing-zone outdoor air flow rate based on two components – the zone occupant component and the zone floor area component, then it calculates the zone supply outdoor air flow rate considering the zone air distribution effectiveness and secondary recirculation (for mult-path systems only), and finally calculates the system outdoor air flow rate considering the zone diversity and system ventilation efficiency. The user must include the following five objects in their input data file in order to model DCV (using VRP or IAQP):</p>
<p>n <strong>AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem</strong> to simulate the mixed air box of the air loop</p>
<p>n <strong>Controller:MechanicalVentilation</strong> with the DCV flag set to 'Yes' to determine the minimum outdoor air flow rate to be provided by the mixed air box</p>
<p>n <strong>Controller:OutdoorAir</strong> to control the outside air flow rate introduced via the mixed air box</p>
<p>n <strong>DesignSpecification:OutdoorAir</strong> to describe the outdoor air requirements for each zone</p>
<p>n <strong>DesignSpecification:ZoneAirDistribution</strong> to describe air distribution effectiveness and secondary recirculation (for multi-path ventilation systems) for each zone</p>
<p>The outdoor air system (AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem) is a subsystem of an AirLoopHVAC which handles the mixed air portion of the primary air system: the system relief air, the outside air inlet, and any components and controllers associated with the system relief air and outside air streams. The inputs for this object are fully described in the EnergyPlus Input Output Reference. Determining the outdoor air ventilation rate and introducing this ventilation via the mixed air box are accomplished by the mechanical ventilation and outdoor air controller objects.</p>
<p>The VRP currently requires outdoor air ventilation rates to be determined based on the floor area of each occupied zone plus the number of people in each zone. The number of people varies based on the setting of the DCV flag in the Controller:MechanicalVentilation object. For using occupancy at every time step, the DCV flag must be set to 'Yes'. The outdoor air ventilation rate can then be reset dynamically as operating conditions change (e.g., variations in occupancy). The Controller:MechanicalVentilation object simplifies the procedure for calculating these outdoor air ventilation requirements and resetting them based on varying occupancy levels. This is particularly useful for large air distribution systems that serve a number of different zone types with varying occupancy levels.</p>
<p>The IAQP (ASHRAE 2007) is a design procedure in which outdoor air intake and other system design parameters are based on an analysis of contaminant sources, and contaminant concentration targets. Although carbon dioxide is not considered as an indoor contaminant but is considered as an indicator of indoor air quality in buildings, EnergyPlus uses IAQP to control carbon dioxide. In addition, a generic contaminant may be introduced. The current IAQP in EnergyPlus allows credit to be taken for controls that can be reliably demonstrated to result in indoor carbon dioxide and generic contaminant concentrations equal to or lower that those achieved using the VRP. The IAQP may also be used where the design is intended to attain specific target carbon dioxide and generic contaminant levels.</p>

<p><strong><em>For multi-path systems,</em></strong></p>

<p>The zone secondary recirculation fraction Er is determined by the designer based on system configuration. For plenum return systems with secondary recirculation (e.g., fan-powered VAV with plenum return) Er is usually less than 1.0, although values may range from 0.1 to 1.2 depending upon the location of the ventilation zone relative to other zones and the air handler. For ducted return systems with secondary recirculation (e.g., fan-powered VAV with ducted return), Er is typically 0.0, while for those with system-level recirculation (e.g, dual-fan dual-duct systems with ducted return) Er is typically 1.0. For other system types, Er is typically 0.75.</p>
<p>The program then calculates the minimum outdoor air flow fraction based on the information provided in the object Controller:MechanicalVentilation and the maximum branch air flow rate as follows:</p>
<p>MechVentOutsideAirMinFrac = <div img="image4729.txt">({V_{ot}})</div> RhoStd / <div img="image4730.txt">(\dot m{_{maxbranch}})</div>here:</p>
<p>MechVentOutsideAirMinFrac = outdoor air minimum fraction based on all zones specified in the Controller:MechanicalVentilation object</p>
<p>Controller:OutdoorAir controls the amount of outdoor ventilation air introduced via the mixed air box based on several user inputs. The user can define the minimum outdoor air flow rate as a percentage of the system’s supply air flow rate (e.g., for a variable-air volume system) or a fixed minimum outdoor air flow rate (not as a percentage but a fixed value) (field MinimumLimit). DCV, using the Controller:MechanicalVentilation object in conjunction with the Controller:OutdoorAir object, allows a third option for setting the minimum outdoor air flow. Economizer operation can also be specified to increase the outdoor air flow above the minimum flow rate to provide free cooling when conditions permit (Controller:OutdoorAir, field Economizer Control Type).</p>
<p>EnergyPlus uses the largest outdoor air flow rate calculated by the various methods described above when modeling system performance (as long this rate doesn’t exceed the maximum flow rate specified for the main air loop branch or for the outdoor air controller itself).</p>
<p>The method used to calculate the outdoor ventilation air flow rate for each system simulation time step is described in more detail below. The figure below schematically illustrates air flow paths used in the calculation of outdoor air flow rate.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../EngineeringReference/media/image4731.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 196.  Demand Control Ventilation -- Air Flow Paths</p>
<p>The minimum outdoor air flow rate is first calculated based on the minimum outdoor air flow rate and the minimum outdoor air schedule value as defined by the user inputs for the object Controller:OutdoorAir:</p>
<div>\[{\mathop m\limits^ \bullet_{\min OA}} = \,{\mathop V\limits^ \bullet_{\min OA}} * \,\,MinOAScheduleValue * \,RhoStd\,\]</div>

<p>where:</p>
<div img="image4733.txt">\({\mathop m\limits^ \bullet_{_{\min OA}}}\)</div>

<p>= minimum outdoor air flow rate for this time step, kg/s</p>
<div img="image4734.txt">\({\mathop V\limits^ \bullet_{_{\min OA}}}\)</div>

<p>= minimum outdoor air flow rate defined in Controller:OutdoorAir, m<sup>3</sup>/s</p>
<p><em>MinOAScheduleValue</em> = minimum outdoor air schedule value defined by the schedule identified in Controller:OutdoorAir</p>
<p><em>RhoStd</em>      = standard air density (1.204 kg/m<sup>3</sup>) adjusted for the local barometric pressure (standard barometric pressure corrected for altitude, ASHRAE 1997 HOF pg. 6.1).</p>
<p>The outdoor air minimum fraction is then calculated as the ratio of the minimum outdoor air flow rate calculated above to the maximum air flow rate defined in the Branch statement for the main air loop (converted to mass flow rate).</p>
<div>\[OutAirMinFrac = \left( {{\raise0.7ex\hbox{${{{\mathop m\limits^ \bullet  }_{_{\min OA}}}}$} \!\mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{{{\mathop m\limits^ \bullet  }_{_{\min OA}}}} {{{\mathop m\limits^ \bullet  }_{_{\max branch}}}}}}\right.}\!\lower0.7ex\hbox{${{{\mathop m\limits^ \bullet  }_{_{\max branch}}}}$}}} \right)\]</div>

<p>where:</p>
<div img="image4736.txt">\({\mathop m\limits^ \bullet_{\max branch}}\)</div>

<p>= Max branch air volume flow rate times <em>RhoStd,</em> kg/s</p>
<p>The program then calculates the minimum outdoor air flow fraction (<em>MechVentOutsideAirMinFrac</em>) according to the VRP based on the information provided in the object Controller:MechanicalVentilation and the maximum branch air flow rate.</p>
<p>The algorithm then uses the larger of these outdoor air minimum fractions in subsequent calculations, and also makes sure that the resulting fraction is between 0 and 1.</p>
<div>\[OutAirMinFrac = \,\,MAX\left( {OutAirMinFrac,MechVentOutsideAirMinFrac} \right)\]</div>

<div>\[OutAirMinFrac = \,\,MIN\left( {MAX\left( {OutAirMinFrac,0.0} \right),\,1.0} \right)\]</div>

<p>The algorithm goes on to determine if economizer operation is possible based on the user inputs and the current conditions of the outdoor air and return air. If conditions permit economizer operation, the outdoor air flow fraction is increased beyond the minimum fraction to meet the mixed air setpoint temperature (setpoint temperature assigned to the node defined in field “Control_Node” of Controller:OutdoorAir).</p>
<div>\[OAFrac = \,MAX\,(OutAirMinFrac,\,EconomizerOAFrac)\]</div>

<p>The mass flow rate of outdoor air is then calculated based on the outdoor air fraction determined above and the mixed (supply) air mass flow rate:</p>
<div>\[{\dot m_{OA}} = OAFrac * {\dot m_{MixedAir}}\]</div>

<p>where:</p>
<div img="image4741.txt">\({\dot m_{OA}}\)</div>

<p>= mass flow rate of outdoor air, kg/s</p>

<div img="image4743.txt">\({\mathop m\limits^ \bullet_{MixedAir}}\)</div>

<p>= mass flow rate of the mixture of return air and outdoor ventilation air, kg/s</p>
<p>The algorithm checks to make sure the calculated outdoor air mass flow rate is greater than or equal to the air flow rate being exhausted.</p>
<div>\[{\dot m_{OA}} = MAX\left( {{{\dot m}_{OA}},{{\dot m}_{ExhaustAir}}} \right)\]</div>

<p>If a fixed minimum outdoor air flow rate is specified (field Minimum Limit Type in Controller:OutdoorAir) for a continuous air flow system, the program makes sure that the outdoor air mass flow rate is greater than or equal to the minimum outdoor air flow rate specified by the user.</p>
<div>\[{\dot m_{OA}} = MAX\left( {{{\dot m}_{OA}},{{\dot m}_{\min OA}}} \right)\]</div>

<p>The outdoor air mass flow rate should be less than or equal to the mixed (supply) air flow rate, and the outdoor air flow rate is reset if necessary.</p>
<div>\[{\dot m_{OA}} = MIN\left( {{{\dot m}_{OA}},{{\dot m}_{MixedAir}}} \right)\]</div>

<p>The outdoor air mass flow rate should also be less than or equal to the maximum outdoor air flow rate specified by the user, and the outdoor air flow rate is reset if necessary.</p>
<div>\[{\dot m_{OA}} = MIN\left( {{{\dot m}_{OA}},{{\dot m}_{MaxOA}}} \right)\]</div>

<p>= maximum outdoor air mass flow rate, kg/s = maximum outdoor air volume flow rate from Controller:OutdoorAir times <em>RhoStd</em></p>
<p>Finally, the relief air flow rate is calculated as the difference between the outside and exhaust air mass flow rates.</p>

<p>This section describes the evaporative coolers models for HVAC in EnergyPlus.</p>
<h3 id="direct-evaporative-cooler">Direct Evaporative Cooler</h3>
<p>The input object EvaporativeCooler:Direct:CelDekPad provides a model of a direct stage evaporative cooler, shown in the figure below, that consists of a rigid media evaporative pad, with water recirculated from a reservoir.  The water is pumped from the reservoir to a water distribution header, for water feed by gravity from above the media.  The evaporative pad provides the area for the adiabatic saturation of the air.  While the process provides a lower dry-bulb temperature, the moisture content of the leaving air is higher than the entering condition.  The direct stage is used for comfort cooling in a building where adding humidity to the air can be tolerated.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../EngineeringReference/media/image4789.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 197.  Direct Stage Evaporative Cooler</p>
<p>The thermodynamic process is a simultaneous heat and mass transfer, or adiabatic cooling, and follows a constant enthalpy line on the psychrometric chart; it is shown in the figure below as a process from A to B.  Since the deviation of the constant wet-bulb line and the constant enthalpy line is small, it is assumed that the wet-bulb temperature is constant across the direct evaporative stage.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../EngineeringReference/media/image4790.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 198.  Psychrometric Chart -- Constant Enthalpy</p>
<p>If the direct evaporative process were 100% efficient, the leaving dry-bulb temperature would equal the entering wet-bulb temperature.  The efficiency of the direct evaporative process is less than 100% and by defining saturation efficiency (ese) for the direct stage or evaporative pad, the leaving dry-bulb temperature can be expressed by the following equation.</p>
<div>\[{T_{dbsupout}} - {T_{dbsupin}} = {\varepsilon_{se}} \cdot \left( {{T_{odb}} - {T_{owb}}} \right)\]</div>

<h4 id="saturation-efficiency">Saturation Efficiency</h4>
<p>Since the evaporative process is not 100% efficient the saturation efficiency is defined by.</p>
<div>\[{\varepsilon_{se}} = \frac{{{T_{dbsupin}} - {T_{dbsupout}}}}{{{T_{odb}} - {T_{owb}}}}\]</div>

<p>The saturation efficiency is determined from manufacturer's data, and the least squares curve fit is discussed in Curve Fitting Evaporative Media section.</p>
<p>Using the saturation efficiency (ese) for the direct stage evaporative pad, the leaving dry-bulb temperature can be determined directly.  The evaporative process approximately follows a constant wet-bulb line.  Therefore, with the leaving dry-bulb temperature and assuming adiabatic heat transfer across the direct stage, the outlet conditions for the direct stage are known.</p>
<p>The saturation efficiency of the direct evaporative cooler is a function of the pad geometry and airflow rate.  The pad geometry is constant throughout the simulation, but the airflow rate can change from hour to hour when the evaporative cooler is used with an air economizer.  The saturation efficiency would then be determined from the flow for that hour with the geometry of the direct evaporative cooler.  This gives the dry-bulb temperature leaving the evaporative cooler.  Assuming adiabatic heat transfer across the direct stage, the evaporative process follows the constant wet-bulb line or the constant enthalpy line on the psychrometric chart, therefore the wet-bulb temperature is constant from inlet to outlet.</p>
<p>Some things that can cause departure from the ideal adiabatic saturation process in the direct evaporative cooler are:</p>
<p>·        makeup water entering the sump,</p>
<p>·        friction from water re-circulation,</p>
<p>·        heat transfer from surroundings,</p>
<p>·        solar radiation (sun upon a cooler).</p>
<p>Thus, adiabatic saturation in evaporative cooling is only an approximation, however the adiabatic saturation assumption in the rigid-media cooler is good, since the water recirculates rapidly and approximates the wet-bulb temperature at steady state operation.</p>
<h4 id="curve-fitting-evaporative-media">Curve Fitting Evaporative Media</h4>
<p>The saturation efficiency is usually reported as a function of airflow, pad face velocity, and pad thickness.  The Figure below shows a typical graph of manufacturer's data for the saturation efficiency.  A multi-variate least squares curve fit of the data was used to generate saturation efficiency functions for the evaporative models that use the CelDek rigid media pad.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../EngineeringReference/media/image4793.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 199.  Graph of Saturation Efficiency</p>
<p>The curve fit for saturation efficiency was obtained using the functions listed below.  The model uses the air velocity (Airvel) through the pad and the depth of the media (Depth).  The least squares routine produced the following model that is used for the evaporative cooling rigid media pad.  The least squares routine produced an eleven-term multi-variate fit using a third order quadratic.</p>
<p>ese = 0.792714 + 0.958569 (Depth) - 0.25193 (Airvel) - 1.03215 (Depth<sup>2</sup>) + 0.0262659 (Airvel<sup>2</sup>) + 0.914869 (Depth * Airvel) - 1.48241 (Airvel * Depth<sup>2</sup>) - 0.018992 (Airvel<sup>3</sup> * Depth) + 1.13137 (Depth<sup>3</sup> * Airvel) + 0.0327622 (Airvel<sup>3</sup> * Depth<sup>2</sup>) - 0.145384 (Depth<sup>3</sup> * Airvel<sup>2</sup>)</p>
<p>Where Airvel is in meters per second and Depth is in meters.  This curve fit is used for the rigid media in the EvapCooler:Direct:CelDekPad and EvapCooler:InDirect:CelDekPad.</p>
<h3 id="dry-coil-indirect-evaporative-cooler">Dry Coil Indirect Evaporative Cooler</h3>
<p>The input object EvaporativeCooler:Indirect:CelDekPad provides a model of a dry coil indirect evaporative cooler, shown in the figure below, that has a rigid media pad, similar to the direct evaporative stage, where the adiabatic cooling takes place.  The secondary air leaves the rigid media pad and enters an air-to-air heat exchanger where it cools the supply air flowing through the heat exchanger tubes.  The moist secondary air is then exhausted to the environment.  The secondary air stream has its own fan and includes consists of a rigid media evaporative pad, with water recirculated from a reservoir.  The water is pumped from the reservoir to a water distribution header, for water feed by gravity from above the media.  The evaporative pad provides the area for the adiabatic saturation of the air.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../EngineeringReference/media/image4794.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 200.  Evaporative Cooler -- Indirect Dry Coil</p>
<p>The process that the secondary air goes through, A to C to D, is shown by the dashed lines in  the following figure.  Process A to C is adiabatic cooling in the rigid media pad.  Then the air enters the shell side of the heat exchanger and is sensibly heated from C to D by the warm supply air passing through the tube side.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../EngineeringReference/media/image4795.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 201.  Secondary Air Process -- Indirect Dry Coil Evap Cooler</p>
<p>The advantage of the dry coil heat exchanger is that the heat exchanger does not have the evaporation taking place on the outside of the tubes, thus no mineral deposits are left on the heat exchange surface to reduce the efficiency of the heat exchanger.  The rigid media pads are designed to flush the mineral deposits to the sump, so the saturation efficiency of the pad stays relatively constant.</p>
<p>The following equations are used to determine the dry-bulb temperature leaving the evaporative media, given pad geometry and secondary airflow information.  The heat transfer in the heat exchanger can be determined with the effectiveness of the heat exchanger according.</p>
<p>Tdb sup out = Tdb sup in - ese*(Todb - Towb )</p>
<p>QHx = eHx * Min( CFMsec , CFMsupply) * rair * cp air * ( Todb - Tdb sec out)</p>
<p>After the heat transfer for the heat exchanger has been determined, an energy balance is done on the supply airside to determine the dry-bulb temperature leaving the indirect evaporative cooler.  This assumes all the energy for is provided by the primary air stream so the effectiveness value includes the air-to-air effectiveness of the heat exchanger.</p>
<p>Tdb sup out =  Tdb sup in   -  <div img="image4796.txt">(\frac{{{Q_{Hx}}}}{{{r_{air}}<em>{c_{pair}}</em>CF{M_{\sup ply}}}})</div></p>
<p>The wet-bulb temperature is determined from psychrometric routines using the leaving dry-bulb temperature, humidity ratio, and barometric pressure, since humidity ratio is constant for the supply air across the indirect stage.  The effectiveness of the heat exchanger is determined from a parameter estimation using manufacturer's performance data.  For the indirect evaporative cooler it was found that a value of 0.67 represented reasonable default effectiveness.</p>
<h3 id="wet-coil-indirect-evaporative-cooler">Wet Coil Indirect Evaporative Cooler</h3>
<p>The input object EvaporativeCooler:Indirect:WetCoil provides a model for a wetted coil evaporative cooler, shown in the figure below, that has water sprayed directly on the tubes of the heat exchanger where latent cooling takes place.  The vaporization of the water on the outside of the heat exchanger tubes allows the simultaneous heat and mass transfer which removes heat from the supply air on the tube side.  Then the moist secondary air is exhausted.  The secondary air stream has its own fan.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../EngineeringReference/media/image4797.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 202.  Wet Coil Indirect Evaporative Cooler</p>
<p>The process that the secondary air goes through, A to C on the following figure, is a path of simultaneous heat and mass transfer, but it does not follow a line of constant enthalpy as in the direct stage.  The process is not adiabatic due to the heat gain from the supply air flowing through the tubes of the heat exchanger.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../EngineeringReference/media/image4798.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 203.  Secondary Air Process – Indirect Wet Coil Evaporative Cooler</p>
<p>The wet coil heat exchanger can have a higher stage efficiency than the dry coil due to a higher heat transfer rate on the outside of the heat exchanger tubes.  Over the operating lifetime of the heat exchanger, the vaporization taking place on the heat exchange surface can leave mineral deposits that will decrease the effectiveness of the heat exchanger.</p>
<h4 id="efficiencies-of-the-indirect-stage">Efficiencies of the Indirect Stage</h4>
<p>In an indirect stage of an evaporative cooler, the secondary or wet side air stream acts as a heat sink for the supply air.  The efficiency of the indirect stage is given as the effectiveness of the sensible heat exchange, eHx, and the saturation efficiency on the wet streamside, ese.  These are expressed as:</p>
<p>eHx = <div img="image4799.txt">(\frac{q}{{{q_{max}}}})</div>=  <div img="image4800.txt">(\frac{{{C_{sup}}({T_{supin}} - {T_{supout}})}}{{{C_{min}}({T_{secin}} - {T_{secout}})}})</div>,</p>
<p>ese =  <div img="image4801.txt">(\frac{{{T_{dbsecin}} - {T_{dbsecout}}}}{{{T_{odb}} - {T_{owb}}}})</div>,</p>
<p>where Tdb sup in = Tdb sec in  for the indirect cooler.  The maximum heat transfer possible would be obtained if the supply stream was cooled all the way to the wet-bulb temperature.  So the efficiency of the indirect evaporative cooler is defined by:</p>
<p>eind =  <div img="image4802.txt">(\frac{{({T_{dbsupin}} - {T_{dbsupout}})}}{{({T_{odb}} - {T_{owb}})}})</div>.</p>
<p>Using the combination of the effectiveness and saturation efficiency, the total efficiency of the indirect stage can be expressed by:</p>
<p>eind = eHx  ese  <div img="image4803.txt">(\frac{{{C_{sup}}}}{{{C_{min}}}})</div>.</p>
<p>In many cases Csup = Cmin and the efficiency of the indirect stage reduces to:</p>
<p>eind = eHx  ese.</p>
<p>An intuitive model determining the performance of the wet coil indirect model was developed.  This model can be used for all indirect models by curve fitting data from the evaporative cooler of interest.  The model development starts with the total efficiency of the indirect evaporative cooler:</p>
<p>eind =  <div img="image4804.txt">(\frac{{({T_{dbsupin}} - {T_{dbsupout}})}}{{({T_{odb}} - {T_{owb}})}})</div></p>
<p>Solving for T db sup out gives the leaving conditions of the supply air at a constant humidity ratio:</p>
<p>T db sup out = Tdb sup in - eind * (Todb - Towb)</p>
<p>A form for the efficiency of the indirect stage was devised using a maximum efficiency with a coefficient to reduce the efficiency depending on the ratio of the airflows.</p>
<p>eind = emax - C1 * (<div img="image4805.txt">(\frac{{CF{M_{sup}}}}{{CF{M_{sec}}}})</div>)</p>
<p>C1 is the "Flow Efficiency Ratio" and is determined from performance data.</p>
<p>A check of limits will verify that it makes physical sense.  As the magnitude of the secondary flow increases, the second term of equation above becomes smaller.  This would make the efficiency tend to go to the maximum efficiency.  Physically this would be true since the convective terms for heat and mass transfer would increase on the outside of the tube with the additional mass flow rate.  Similarly, if the supply air flow goes to zero with a constant secondary air flow, the second term of the equation above again becomes small, and the overall efficiency of the stage would approach the maximum.  The constant C1 tells how quickly the efficiency of the stage would decrease with a mismatch of the supply and secondary flows.</p>
<p>The maximum efficiency of the stage is a combination of the efficiency due to the simultaneous heat and mass transfer on the outside of the tube and the efficiency of the heat exchanger.  This value can be higher than the dry coil overall efficiency since the convective coefficients on the outside of the tube are larger.  For example, a least squares fit for the maximum efficiency showed this value was approximately 0.8 compared to the dry coil indirect value of approximately 0.65 (0.67 * 0.97).  (The maximum efficiency for the dry coil indirect was determined at the condition where flow through the evaporative pad in the secondary air stream approached zero, for a 12-inch thick pad.)  It should be noted again that over the operating life of the wet coil heat exchanger, the mineral deposits that are left can decrease the effectiveness of the heat exchanger unless appropriate maintenance has taken place.  Therefore, if modeling an older system, the manufacturer’s data may no longer describe the equipment effectiveness.</p>
<h3 id="two-stage-directindirect-evaporative-cooler">Two Stage Direct/Indirect Evaporative Cooler</h3>
<p>A two stage cooler can be modeled by combining either a wet coil or the dry coil indirect evaporative cooler staged with a direct evaporative cooler.  The figure below shows a dry coil indirect evaporative cooler with a direct evaporative cooler.  This configuration is mainly used for total comfort cooling for a building and would not normally be used as a pre-cooler for a refrigeration coil, since the direct stage would increase the latent load on a refrigeration coil.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../EngineeringReference/media/image4806.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 204.  Two Stage Evaporative Cooler</p>
<p>The thermodynamic process for the supply air is shown below, going from A to B to C.  The process from A to B is sensible cooling in the indirect stage.  The process from B to C is simultaneous heat and mass transfer following a constant enthalpy line.  The air leaving the final stage has a lower dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperature, and an increase in moisture from the direct stage.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../EngineeringReference/media/image4807.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 205.  Thermodynamic Process for Supply Air Through Two Stage Evaporative Cooler</p>
<p>Two stage evaporative coolers can be accomplished by putting the EvaporativeCooler:Direct:CelDekPad, EvaporativeCooler:Indirect:CelDekPad, EvaporativeCooler:Indirect:WetCoil in series in any combination the user desires in the supply air loop.</p>
<h3 id="indirect-evaporative-cooler-special-research-model">Indirect Evaporative Cooler Special Research Model</h3>
<p>This section summarizes the model implemented in the component EvaporativeCooler:Indirect:ResearchSpecial.  Examples of this evaporative cooler are shown in the following figures, without and with a relief valve. This model differs from the other indirect evaporative coolers in that, under part load conditions, it can modulate so that the air leaving the cooler just meets a drybulb temperature setpoint.  It is also a simple model with a constant effectiveness.</p>

<p>The purge air, or secondary airside, is the stream that evaporates water and indirectly cools the primary, or system air.  The result from Equation is then compared to a lower bound, <div img="image4814.txt">({T_{db,out,bound}})</div>, determined from the dewpoint of the incoming purge air using Equation .</p>
<div>\[{T_{db,out,bound}} = {T_{db,in,sys}} - \beta ({T_{db,in,sys}} - {T_{dew,in,purge}})\]</div>

<p>is a factor for how close to dewpoint is possible (eg. 0.9)</p>
<p>The final result (for PLF = 1) is the larger of the results from Equations and .</p>
<p>The indirect cooler has the ability to overcool the air and therefore needs some form of modulation.  A Part Load Fraction, PLF, is used to model the implications of controlling the amount of cooling.  It is assumed that through on/off cycling that the cooling power can be varied to exactly meet the desired temperature when PLF is less than unity.  The auxiliary fan power is then varied linearly using a Part Load Fraction.</p>
<div>\[{\dot Q_{Full}} = \dot m\left( {{h_{out,sys}} - {h_{in,sys}}} \right)\]</div>

<div>\[{\dot Q_{{\mathop{\rm Re}\nolimits} quired}} = \dot m\left( {{h_{out,desired}} - {h_{in,sys}}} \right)\]</div>

<div>\[PLF = \frac{{{{\dot Q}_{{\mathop{\rm Re}\nolimits} quired}}}}{{{{\dot Q}_{Full}}}}\]</div>

<p>where,</p>
<div img="image4821.txt">\(PLF\)</div>

<p>is the Part Load Fraction</p>
<p>When PLF is less than 1.0 it is assumed that the cooler will deliver the desired temperature air (as long as it is less than the inlet; it doesn’t need heating).  The PLF is used to modify the auxiliary fan power and find when the unit will overcool.</p>
<div>\[{P_{fan}} = \Delta P\cdot \dot V\cdot e\cdot PLF\]</div>

<p>Water pump power is also derated using the PLF.</p>
<p>A third air stream input to the cooler was implemented in order to allow mixing building exhaust air with outdoor air on the purge/secondary side of the cooler. The assumption when relief/tertiary air is used is that all of the available relief zone air is used and the remainder made up with outdoor air.  Moisture and energy balances are drawn to compute humidity ratio and enthalpy of mixed secondary air.  The volume is determined by the design volume flow rate (from secondary fan size).</p>
<h4 id="water-consumption">Water Consumption</h4>
<p>Water consumption is an important consideration when evaluating evaporative coolers.  Water consumption of the evaporative cooler is modeled using Equation .</p>
<div>\[{\dot V_{water}} = {\dot V_{evap}} + {\dot V_{drift}} + {\dot V_{blowdown}}\]</div>

<p>The three components of water consumption are evaporation, drift, and blowdown.  Evaporation is the water evaporated as the normal part of the evaporative cooler thermodynamic process and is calculated using:</p>

<h3 id="direct-evaporative-cooler-special-research-model">Direct Evaporative Cooler Special Research Model</h3>
<p>This section summarizes the model implemented in the component EvaporativeCooler:Direct:ResearchSpecial.  This is a simple constant effectiveness model that, under part load conditions, can modulate so that the air leaving the cooler just meets a drybulb temperature setpoint.  The algorithm used to determine the changes to the system air proceeds in three steps:</p>
<p>1)    calculate full load performance using a part load fraction (PLF)=1 and Equation .</p>
<p>2)    calculate PLF using Equations , , and .</p>
<p>3)    recalculate cooler performance using the PLF.</p>
<div>\[\begin{array}{l}{T_{db,out}} = {T_{db,in}} - \varepsilon \left( {{T_{db,in}} - {T_{wb,in}}} \right)\\\end{array}\]</div>

<p>where,</p>
<div img="image4835.txt">\({T_{db,out}}\)</div>

<p>is the drybub temperature of the air leaving the cooler [ºC],</p>

<div img="image4837.txt">\({T_{wb,in}}\)</div>

<p>is the wetbulb temperature of the air entering the cooler [ºC], and</p>
<div img="image4838.txt">\(\varepsilon \)</div>

<p>is the cooler effectiveness.</p>
<p>The wetbulb temperature of air leaving a direct cooler is the same as the wetbulb temperature entering the cooler.  The leaving humidity ratio of the air is calculated using psychrometric functions with with leaving drybulb and wetbulb temperatures and outdoor air pressure as inputs.  The leaving enthalpy of air is calculated using pyschrometric functions with leaving drybulb temperature, leaving humidity ratio, and outdoor air pressure as inputs.</p>
<p>The direct cooler sometimes has the ability to overcool the air and therefore some form of modulation is useful for analysis.  The special research model includes a Part Load Fraction, PLF, used to model the implications of controlling the amount of cooling.  It is assumed that through some sort of on/off cycling or wetness control that the cooling power can be varied to exactly meet the desired temperature when PLF is less than unity.  The auxiliary water pump power is then varied linearly using a Part Load Fraction.</p>
<div>\[{\rm{FullOutput}} = {T_{db,out}} - {T_{db,in}}\]</div>

<div>\[{\rm{RequiredOutput}} = {T_{db,desired}} - {T_{db,in}}\]</div>

<div>\[PLF = \frac{{{\rm{RequiredOutput}}}}{{{\rm{FullOutput}}}}\]</div>

<p>When PLF is less than 1.0 it is assumed that the cooler will deliver the desired temperature air (as long as it is less than the inlet; it doesn’t need heating).  Water pump power is also derated using the PLF.</p>
<h4 id="water-consumption_1">Water Consumption</h4>
<p>Water consumption is an important consideration when evaluating evaporative coolers.  Water consumption of the evaporative cooler is modeled using Equation .</p>
<div>\[{\dot V_{water}} = {\dot V_{evap}} + {\dot V_{drift}} + {\dot V_{blowdown}}\]</div>

<p>The three components of water consumption are evaporation, drift, and blowdown.  Evaporation is the water evaporated as the normal part of the evaporative cooler thermodynamic process and is calculated using:</p>

<div>\[{\dot V_{drift}} = {\dot V_{evap}} * {f_{drift}}\]</div>

<h2 id="air-system-fans">Air System Fans <a name="Fans"></a></h2>
<h3 id="overview_3">Overview</h3>
<p>Three input objects (Fan:ConstantVolume, Fan:VariableVolume, and Fan:OnOff) provide models for fans -- the prime movers in most of the air loop and zonal air conditioning systems in EnergyPlus. For these input objects, EnergyPlus uses a simple polynomial-based curve-fit model to describe the relation between the volumetric flow rate and the fan electric power, with no explicit modeling of fan pressure rise. Consequently, duct-static-pressure reset strategies cannot be modeled using this approach. For CAV and VAV central air-handling systems, a fourth input object (Fan:ComponentModel) provides a simple physics-based model for flow-dependent fan pressure rise and detailed models for fan, belt, motor, and variable-frequency-drive efficiencies and energy use. This latter input object provides the capability to analyze the effects of duct-static-pressure reset strategies, as well as changes in fan system element performance. All of these fan models calculate the fan energy usage, which is often a large fraction of HVAC energy use and a significant portion of the building energy consumption. They also calculate the temperature rise in the air stream caused by the static pressure increase as the air goes through the fan. If the motor and belt are in the air stream, waste heat from the motor and belt also acts to raise the air stream temperature.</p>
<h3 id="model">Model</h3>
<p>Each of the four fan models is a forward type: the model inputs describe the fan characteristics and the conditions of the air at the fan inlet; the outputs are the fan electrical power consumption and the conditions of the air at the fan outlet. The model algorithms and data are contained in the <em>Fans</em> module in EnergyPlus.</p>
<h4 id="inputs-and-data">Inputs and Data</h4>
<p>For the Fan:ConstantVolume, Fan:VariableVolume, and Fan:OnOff models, the user describes the fan by entering values for the design pressure rise across the fan, the design volumetric flow rate, the fan total efficiency, and the fan motor efficiency. The user also needs to specify the fraction of the fan waste heat that will enter the air stream (usually 0 or 1). For the Fan:VariableVolume model, the user must also enter the coefficients of a 4<sup>th</sup> order polynomial that relates the fan mass flow rate to the fan power consumption.The independent variable is the volumetric flow fraction; the dependent variable is the fan power part load ratio. For multi-speed fans, the user must enter a fan power ratio as a function of speed ratio performance curve name. Multi-speed fans can only be simulated in a parent object which allows multiple fan speeds (e.g., AirLoopHVAC:Unitary:Furnace:HeatCool, ZoneHVAC:PackagedTerminalAirConditioner, etc.). An optional efficiency curve may also be used when simulating multi-speed fans to adjust the fan total efficiency as the fan speed changes.</p>
<p>For the Fan:ComponentModel object, the user describes the fan in more detail, and also describes the duct system characteristics as seen by the fan. In particular, the user specifies a pressure rise curve with four coefficients that relates the fan total pressure rise to the volumetric flow through the fan, the duct-static-pressure set-point, and the static pressure of the spaces surrounding the ducts. If duct-static-pressure reset is used, the user enters a linear curve with two coefficients that relates the pressure set-point to the volumetric flow through the fan. For the fan itself, the user specifies the fan geometry (wheel diameter and outlet area), maximum efficiency, the Euler number corresponding to the maximum efficiency, the maximum dimensionless flow, the names of four curves with several coefficients that describe the variation of fan efficiency and dimensionless flow with the Euler number in the normal and stall operation regions of the fan, and a sizing factor (applied to the maximum flow through the fan). For the belt, the user specifies the maximum efficiency (or a curve with five coefficients that defines the maximum efficiency as a function of maximum fan shaft input power), three curves with three coefficients each that relate the belt part-load efficiency to belt fractional output torque, the motor/fan pulley diameter ratio, the belt output torque capacity, and a sizing factor (applied to the maximum output torque of the belt). For the motor, the user specifies the maximum efficiency (or a curve with three coefficients that define the maximum efficiency as a function of maximum belt input power), a curve with three coefficients that relate the motor part-load efficiency to motor fractional output power, and a sizing factor (applied to the maximum output power of the motor). For the variable-frequency-drive (VFD), the user specifies a curve with three coefficients that relate the VFD part-load efficiency to motor fractional input power or to motor fractional speed, and a sizing factor (applied to the maximum output power of the VFD).</p>
<h4 id="control">Control</h4>
<p>The models must decide whether the fan is on or off. The primary on/off trigger is the fan schedule. This is an on/off schedule associated with each fan: a value of 1 indicates the fan is on; a value of 0 indicates the fan is off. The fan schedule can be overruled by flags set by system availability managers. If the flag <em>TurnFansOn</em> is true, a zero fan schedule value will be overridden and the fan will be turned on. If the flag <em>TurnFansOff</em> is true the fan will be forced off. The inlet air mass flow rate must be greater than zero for the fan to be on.</p>
<p>Generally the fan is a passive component: it accepts the mass flow on its inlet node, uses it in its calculations of energy consumption and temperature rise, and passes it to the outlet node. However the fan maximum and minimum airflow rates act as absolute limits on the airflow rate.</p>
<p>For multi-speed fans, the parent object determines the fan speed ratio (i.e., the selected speed of the fan motor) and uses this value in conjunction with the fan power ratio performance curve to calculate the full load fan power. This full load fan power is then used to determine the part-load performance of the fan and motor assembly.</p>
<h4 id="simulation">Simulation</h4>
<p>Simple (Single Speed) Fan Model</p>
<p>The following equations define the model for this fan:</p>
<div>\[{\dot Q_{tot}} = \dot m\cdot \Delta P/({e_{tot}}\cdot {\rho_{air}})\]</div>

<div>\[{\dot Q_{shaft}} = {e_{motor}}\cdot {\dot Q_{tot}}\]</div>

<div>\[{\dot Q_{toair}} = {\dot Q_{shaft}} + ({\dot Q_{tot}} - {\dot Q_{shaft}})\cdot {f_{motortoair}}\]</div>

<div>\[{h_{out}} = {h_{in}} + {\dot Q_{toair}}/\dot m\]</div>

<div>\[{w_{out}} = {w_{in}}\]</div>

<div>\[{T_{out}} = PsyTdbFnHW({h_{out}},{w_{out}})\]</div>

<p>On/Off Fan Model</p>
<p>The on/off fan model is similar to the simple fan model with the exception that the on/off fan may cycle on and off during a simulation time step. The cycling rate of the fan is known as the run time fraction. The calculation of run time fraction accounts for the part-load losses of other equipment used in the HVAC system. A part-load factor (a.k.a. part-load ratio) is first calculated for the fan as the ratio of the actual operating mass flow rate to the maximum fan mass flow rate. The run time fraction is then calculated as the part-load factor divided by the part-load fraction. The part-load fraction is determined by other HVAC equipment in the simulation (Ref. DX coil) for use by this specific fan model.</p>
<div>\[{f_{flow}} = {\raise0.7ex\hbox{${\mathop m\limits^ \bullet  }$} \!\mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{\mathop m\limits^ \bullet  } {{{\mathop m\limits^ \bullet  }_{\max }}}}}\right.}\!\lower0.7ex\hbox{${{{\mathop m\limits^ \bullet  }_{\max }}}$}}\]</div>

<div>\[RTF = {\raise0.7ex\hbox{${{f_{flow}}}$} \!\mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{{f_{flow}}} {PLF}}}\right.}\!\lower0.7ex\hbox{${PLF}$}}\]</div>

<p>The total fan power is then calculated as the maximum fan power multipled by the run time fraction.</p>
<div>\[{\mathop Q\limits^\cdot_{tot}} = RTF\left[ {\mathop m\limits^\cdot  \cdot \Delta P/\left( {{e_{tot}}\cdot {\rho_{air}}} \right)} \right]\]</div>

<p>The remaining calculations are the same as those described in the simple single-speed fan mode.</p>
<p>Multi-Speed Fan Model</p>
<p>The model used to simulate a multi-speed fan relies on the general fan laws to correct for speed changes in the fan’s motor and the corresponding change in fan power and fan total efficiency. Two performance curves are used to define the change in power and efficiency as shown below. The power ratio curve must be used to simulate a multi-speed fan. The power ratio curve modifies the fan power based on a change in fan speed according to the cubic fan law. Exponents other than 3 are allowed. The efficiency ratio curve is used to correct for changes in nominal efficiency at alternate fan speeds. If either or both of these curves are not provided, the ratio is assumed to be 1.</p>
<p>The power ratio term is evaluated using an exponent performance curve. The form of the exponent curve equation is shown below.</p>
<div>\[ExponentCurveOutput = C1 + C2*{x^{C3}}\]</div>

<p>The exponent performance curve is used to evaluate the power ratio as a function of speed ratio (x in the equation above). For typical fan performance, coefficient C1 = 0 and coefficient C2 = 1. The exponent (C3) is typically equal to 3 (cubed fan law) but other values are allowed.</p>
<div>\[PowerRatio = f{\left( {{N_{ratio}}} \right)^n} = ExponentCurveOutput\]</div>

<p>The efficiency ratio curve is a quadratic or cubic curve used to evaluate the efficiency ratio as a function of speed ratio (x in the following equation). The cubic equation form is shown below.</p>
<div>\[EfficiencyCurveOutput = C1 + C2{\left( x \right)^2} + C3{\left( x \right)^3}\]</div>

<p>The curve coefficients are determine by correlating the normalized fan total efficiency (i.e., the actual fan total efficiency divided by the nominal fan total efficiency at a speed ratio of 1) to the speed ratio (i.e., the ratio of actual air flow rate through the fan to the maximum fan air flow rate).</p>
<div>\[EfficiencyRatio = f\left( {{N_{ratio}}} \right) = EfficiencyCurveOutput\]</div>

<p>To account for the change in fan speed and to ensure that the run time fraction is accurately calculated, an adjustment to the previous calculation for run time fraction is made. This adjusts the calculated run time fraction to account for times when the fan speed has been reduced and the new speed is now considered the fan’s maximum speed. The speed adjusted run time fraction is then used in the fan power calculation.</p>
<div>\[RTF = {\raise0.7ex\hbox{${RTF}$} \!\mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{RTF} {{N_{ratio}}}}}\right.}\!\lower0.7ex\hbox{${{N_{ratio}}}$}}\]</div>

<div>\[{\mathop Q\limits^ \bullet_{tot}} = RTF\left[ {\frac{{\mathop m\limits^ \bullet  \Delta P}}{{{e_{tot}}{\rho_{air}}}}} \right]\left( {\frac{{PowerRatio}}{{EfficiencyRatio}}} \right)\]</div>

<p>Each of the performance curves described above may be used to model the performance of a multi-speed fan motor, however, the power ratio curve must be used to envoke the multi-speed simulation. These curves are used when the fan is used in an HVAC system having multiple flow rates (i.e., different flow rates in cooling and heating mode). If an HVAC system operates at the same speed in either cooling or heating mode, these curves are not required. When these curves are not used, the associated ratio term in the equation above is assumed to be 1. The remaining calculations are identical to the simple single-speed fan model described above.</p>
<p>Variable Speed Fan Model</p>
<p>The model for the variable speed fan is similar to the simple single-speed fan model except for a part load factor that multiplies the fan power consumption.</p>
<div>\[{f_{flow}} = \dot m/{\dot m_{design}}\]</div>

<div>\[{f_{pl}} = {c_1} + {c_2} \cdot {f_{flow}} + {c_3} \cdot f_{flow}^2 + {c_4} \cdot f_{flow}^3 + {c_5} \cdot f_{flow}^4\]</div>

<div>\[{\dot Q_{tot}} = {f_{pl}}\cdot {\dot m_{design}}\cdot \Delta P/\left( {{e_{tot}}\cdot {\rho_{air}}} \right)\]</div>

<p>The rest of the calculation is the same as for the simple fan.</p>

<p>Component Fan Model</p>
<p>The Fan:ComponentModel object is based upon combining: modified forms of fan, belt, motor, and variable-frequency-drive (VFD) element models (Stein and Hydeman 2004); a simplified fan pressure rise model with distribution system leakage, duct static pressure, and conditioned space pressure control effects included (Sherman and Wray 2010); and a diagnostic-based simplified duct static-pressure reset (SPR) scheme for air-handling systems (Federspiel 2004, 2005).</p>
<p>Fan <em>electric</em> power depends on fan <em>air</em> power (product of the airflow through and pressure rise across the fan), mechanical efficiencies (fan and belt), and electrical efficiencies (motor and drive). For systems with variable flows, none of these parameters is constant and all are interrelated. For example, Figure 208 shows that fan efficiency strongly depends on fan flow <em>as well as</em> pressure rise, although this is not obvious from the manufacturer’s power and speed performance map (top left). Fan efficiency maps can be derived from the manufacturer’s performance map using a commercially-available software-based data extraction tool such as DigitizeIt and by applying the following equation to the extracted data:</p>
<div img="image4887.txt">\({\eta_{fan}} = \frac{{\Delta {P_{fan}} \cdot {Q_{fan}}}}{{{H_{fan}}}}\)</div>

<p>()</p>
<p>where <strong>Δ</strong><em>P<sub>fan</sub></em>is the fan pressure rise (Pa); <em>Q<sub>fan</sub></em> is the fan flow at standard conditions (m<sup>3</sup>/s); and <em>H<sub>fan</sub></em> is the fan shaft power (W). Fan speed values also can be derived from the manufacturer’s performance map using a similar software-based data extraction tool.</p>
<p>Fan pressure rise must be sufficient to overcome the air-handling system pressure drop, which depends on duct static pressure, on duct and equipment leakage, and on pressure drops across duct and duct-like elements (e.g., dampers, fittings), coils, and filters that are connected to the fan. Duct and duct-like pressure drops increase approximately as the square of the flow through them. However, pressure drops across coils and filters behave differently: they are proportional to the flow raised to a power n, which can approach one for high-efficiency filters and wet coils (Liu et al. 2003, Trane 1999).</p>
<p>The relation between system pressure drop and flow defines what is commonly called a “system curve”. When system characteristics change, such as when the duct static pressure set point is varied, a family of system curves results. The intersections of these curves with fan curves (e.g., power as a function of pressure rise and flow) on a pressure versus flow plot define one or more loci of unique fan operating points. Each of these points has an associated fan efficiency, power, and speed.</p>

 (Dashed Parabolic Curve is “Do Not Select Line”)</p>
<p><em>Fan Pressure Rise Model</em>: To calculate fan pressure rise based on flow through the fan, Sherman and Wray (2010) have developed a simple physics-based data-driven four parameter duct system model for the purpose of simulating its system curve. The embodiment of the model for a fixed outdoor air fraction that can be applied to constant- or variable-volume central air-handling systems is:</p>
<div img="image4889.txt">\(\Delta {P_{fan,tot}} = {A_{fpr}}Q_{fan}^2 + {B_{fpr}}Q_{fan}^{} + {C_{fpr}}Q_{fan}^{}\sqrt {{P_{sm}} - {P_o}}  + {D_{fpr}}\left( {{P_{sm}} - {P_o}} \right)\)</div>

<p>()</p>
<p>where <strong>Δ</strong><em>P<sub>fan,tot</sub></em> is the fan total pressure rise (Pa); <em>Q<sub>fan</sub></em> is the fan flow at standard conditions (m<sup>3</sup>/s); <em>P<sub>sm</sub></em> is the duct static pressure set point (Pa); <em>P<sub>o</sub></em> is the static pressure of the spaces surrounding the ducts (Pa); and <em>A<sub>fpr</sub></em>, <em>B<sub>fpr</sub></em>, <em>C<sub>fpr</sub></em>, and <em>D<sub>fpr</sub></em> are constant coefficients that represent different aspects of the fan pressure rise model as described below.</p>
<p>Fan static pressure rise is determined from the total pressure rise by subtracting the outlet velocity pressure:</p>
<div img="image4890.txt">\(\Delta {P_{fan}} = \Delta {P_{fan,tot}} - \frac{\rho }{2}{\left( {\frac{{{Q_{fan}}}}{{{A_{fan,out}}}}} \right)^2}\)</div>

<p>()</p>
<p>where <em>A<sub>fan,out</sub></em> is the fan outlet area (m<sup>2</sup>) and <em>ρ</em> is the air density at the fan inlet (kg/m<sup>3</sup>).</p>
<p>The first term in Equation looks like the common system curve in which the fan pressure rise is proportional to the square of the fan flow, but here it also depends implicitly on supply and return pressure losses, and in part on the fraction of the fan flow that is outdoor air (essentially “leaks” into and out of the return side of the system). Very often it is the only term considered, but that would only be correct with fixed-position dampers, no distribution system leakage, no linear resistance components, and no duct static pressure control.</p>
<p>The second term accounts for significant flow resistances in the system where the pressure difference is linearly proportional to the flow. Some filters and coils in the return may need this term to be adequately described. This term could be ignored if there are no linear components or if their pressure drops are very small compared to the other terms.</p>
<p>The third term, which depends on the fan flow and square root of the supply duct pressure <em>P<sub>sm</sub></em>, accounts in part for air leakage from the supply system when damper positions are fixed or are changed independently of static pressure or fan flow. In this case, reducing or eliminating supply leakage results in a different system curve. This, however, might be only a minor “correction” to the simple system curves generally used. The third term is zero when VAV box dampers are modulated to control flow. Consequently, with variable-position supply dampers, reducing or eliminating supply leakage does not change the system curve.</p>
<p>The last term also accounts in part for leakage from the supply system when damper positions are fixed or are changed independently of static pressure or fan flow. This term indicates that the same fan pressure rise can be achieved by raising the duct pressure and closing dampers. The only change in the system in such a case is that the leakage flow may increase. The coefficient for this term is equal to one when the VAV box dampers are modulated to control flow. In both cases, this term may be the most important “correction” to the simple system curves generally used, especially at low flows.</p>
<p>In principle, especially for research applications of Energy Plus, the four individual fan pressure rise coefficients can be determined using duct design calculation tools for the entire system (e.g., Right-CommDuct, UNI-DUCT, Ductsize, Varitrane Duct Designer, T-Duct). In practice, however, especially for existing buildings, the necessary details may not be known sufficiently. In that case, one can make active measurements at different combinations of fan flows, outside air fractions, damper positions (if they are variable), and duct static pressures and then use non-linear system identification techniques to fit the data and determine the coefficients. If passive measurements can be made over a sufficiently long time so that a wide range of outside air settings, damper positions, and fan flows is obtained, one could instead regress the data to find all of the parameters in the equation. Unfortunately, there are no standardized test procedures available to draw upon, even though some standards appear to be related (e.g., ASHRAE 1999, 2008). Consequently, field test protocols need to be developed to determine the parameters for the new duct system model. These protocols then need to be integrated into standardized data collection and analysis tools such as Pacific Gas and Electric’s “Universal Translator” tool. The California Energy Commission is funding such a project; data, procedures, and tools from this project will support the EnergyPlus implementation of the fan and duct system models described here.</p>
<p><em>SPR Model</em>: The model for duct-static-pressure reset (SPR) is based on a simple diagnostic procedure and a linear correlation between duct static pressure and supply fan airflow (Federspiel 2004, 2005). The diagnostic method involves measuring the static pressure at the duct static pressure sensor and the velocity pressure at the fan inlet (represents the fan flow) at multiple points over the fan’s operating range, while the VAV box dampers attempt to control flow in response to a constant thermostat setpoint. The goal of the test is to define the lowest duct static pressure where all VAV boxes are still in control (dampers modulating). In the model, the correlation between <em>P<sub>sm</sub></em> and <em>Q<sub>fan</sub></em> is as follows for <em>Q<sub>fan,min</sub></em> ≤ <em>Q<sub>fan</sub></em> ≤ <em>Q<sub>fan,max</sub></em>:</p>
<div img="image4891.txt">\({P_{sm}} = {P_{sm,\min }} + \left( {{P_{sm,\max }} - {P_{sm,\min }}} \right)*\frac{{\left( {{Q_{fan}} - {Q_{fan,\min }}} \right)}}{{\left( {{Q_{fan,\max }} - {Q_{fan,\min }}} \right)}} = {C_1} + {C_2}*{Q_{fan}}\)</div>

<p>For <em>Q<sub>fan</sub></em> &lt; <em>Q<sub>fan,min</sub></em>, <em>P<sub>sm</sub></em> = <em>P<sub>sm,min</sub></em>;for<em>Q<sub>fan</sub></em> &gt; <em>Q<sub>fan,max</sub></em>, <em>P<sub>sm</sub></em> = <em>P<sub>sm,max</sub></em></p>
<p><em>Fan Efficiency and Shaft Input Power Model</em>: A dimensionless parameter in the form of an Euler number can be used to simplify the description of fan static efficiency variations:</p>
<div img="image4894.txt">\(Eu = \frac{{\left( {\Delta {P_{fan}} * D_{fan}^4} \right)}}{{\left( {\rho  * Q_{fan}^2} \right)}}\)</div>

<p>()</p>
<p>where <strong>Δ</strong><em>P<sub>fan</sub></em> is the fan static pressure rise (Pa), <em>D<sub>fan</sub></em> is the fan wheel outer diameter (m), <em>ρ</em> is the air density at the fan inlet (kg/m<sup>3</sup>), and <em>Q<sub>fan</sub></em> is the fan flow at standard conditions (m<sup>3</sup>/s). <em>Eu</em> is nominally the ratio of pressure forces across the fan to inertial forces at the fan wheel exit.</p>
<p>By plotting the normalized fan static efficiency (<em>static efficiency / maximum static efficiency</em>) versus the logarithm base 10 of the normalized Euler number (<em>Eu</em> <em>/</em> <em>Eu</em> <em>at maximum static efficiency</em>), the dimensionless performance of various fan sizes is very similar (as one might expect from the “fan laws”), but so also is the dimensionless performance of different <em>types</em> of fans (e.g., single-inlet plenum fans, double-inlet housed centrifugal fans, mixed flow fans, vane axial fans, fans with backward or forward curved blades). An example of this correlation for the “normal operation” (non-stall) and stall regions of eight fans is shown in Figure 209.</p>

<p>This model uses a continuous function to represent the normalized fan efficiency (<em>η<sub>fan</sub></em>) variation. The normalized exponential-conditioned skew-normal functional relationship is:</p>
<div img="image4896.txt">\(\frac{{{\eta_{fan}}({x_{fan}})}}{{{\eta_{fan,\max }}}} = \frac{{{e^{( - 0.5*Z_1^2)}}[1 + \frac{{{Z_2}}}{{\left| {{Z_2}} \right|}} \bullet erf\left( {\frac{{\left| {{Z_2}} \right|}}{{\sqrt 2 }}} \right)}}{{{e^{( - 0.5*Z_3^2)}}[1 + \frac{{{Z_3}}}{{\left| {{Z_3}} \right|}} \bullet erf\left( {\frac{{\left| {{Z_3}} \right|}}{{\sqrt 2 }}} \right)}}\)</div>

<p>()</p>
<p>where</p>
<p>x<sub>fan</sub> = log<sub>10</sub>(Eu / Eu<sub>max</sub>)</p>
<p>Z<sub>1</sub> = (x<sub>fan</sub> - a<sub>fan</sub>) / b<sub>fan</sub>;  Z<sub>2</sub> = ((e<sup>(c</sup>fan<sup>*x</sup>fan<sup>)</sup>*d<sub>fan</sub>*x<sub>fan</sub>) - a<sub>fan</sub>) / b<sub>fan</sub>;  Z<sub>3</sub> = -a<sub>fan</sub> / b<sub>fan</sub></p>
<p>For conceptual design when only rough estimates are needed, a generic curve (also shown in Figure 209) can be used and then one only needs to know the maximum efficiency (<em>η<sub>fan,max</sub></em>) and <em>Eu</em> at that maximum (<em>Eu<sub>max</sub></em>) to entirely model the fan efficiency and hence fan power. The dimensionless coefficients for the generic normalized fan efficiency curve are as follows:</p>
<p><em>a<sub>fan</sub></em>= -2.732094, <em>b<sub>fan</sub></em> = 2.273014,<em>c<sub>fan</sub></em> = 0.196344, <em>d<sub>fan</sub></em> = 5.267518</p>
<p>In this case, the coefficient of determination R<sup>2</sup> is 0.994. Also, the average and RMS differences between the efficiency values based on extracted data and the fitted generic curve are, respectively, about 0.5% and 1.4%; maximum differences are about ±9%.</p>
<p>If more accuracy is needed for a specific fan, a similarly shaped curve can be developed for that fan (using extracted data, Equation , and least-squares regression techniques), segmented into normal operation and stall regions with specific coefficients fitted for each region. Figure 210 shows an example, using the data from Figure 208.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../EngineeringReference/media/image4897.svg" /></p>

<p>For this specific fan, the coefficients are:</p>

<p>In this case, the average and RMS differences between the efficiency values based on extracted data and fitted specific curve (R<sup>2</sup> is 0.999) are, respectively, about -0.1% and 0.3%; maximum differences are about ±0.7%. Field tests are especially needed to determine the coefficients for installed fans because fans are susceptible to “system effects” (e.g., inlet obstructions) that are not included in the manufacturer test data (AMCA 1990a).</p>
<p>To determine fan efficiency and fan shaft power at a particular time step, first calculate the fan pressure rise (<strong>Δ</strong><em>P<sub>fan</sub></em>) using the time step fan flow (<em>Q<sub>fan</sub></em>) and Equation (and also using Equations and if there is SPR). Next, calculate <em>Eu</em> using Equation and then <em>x<sub>fan</sub></em> (log<sub>10</sub> normalized <em>Eu</em>), which is based on <em>Eu</em> and the specified <em>Eu<sub>max</sub></em> (<em>Eu</em> at maximum efficiency) for the fan. The corresponding normalized efficiency (<em>η<sub>fan</sub></em>(<em>x<sub>fan</sub></em>) <em>/ η<sub>fan,max</sub></em>) is obtained using Equation . The fan efficiency (<em>η<sub>fan</sub></em>(<em>x<sub>fan</sub></em>)) therefore is:</p>
<div img="image4898.txt">\({\eta_{fan}}\left( {{x_{fan}}} \right) = {\eta_{fan,\max }}\left[ {\frac{{{\eta_{fan}}\left( {{x_{fan}}} \right)}}{{{\eta_{fan,\max }}}}} \right]\)</div>

<p>()</p>
<p>The fan shaft input power (mechanical, W) is:</p>
<div img="image4899.txt">\({H_{fan}} = \frac{{\Delta {P_{fan}} \cdot {Q_{fan}}}}{{{\eta_{fan}}\left( {{x_{fan}}} \right)}}\)</div>

<p>()</p>
<p><em>Fan Shaft Speed and Torque Modeling</em>: For rotating elements, power (<em>H</em>) is the product of torque (<em>τ</em>) and rotational speed (ω), or conversely, torque is power divided by rotational speed (<em>τ =H / ω</em>).</p>
<p>The Stein and Hydeman variable-frequency-drive (VFD) component model correlates VFD efficiency as a linear function of VFD fractional output power (i.e., motor input power). Available data for about 50 drives from Saftronics were apparently used to develop their model, but those data represent VFD efficiency as a function of motor fractional speed
 (<em>ω<sub>motor</sub> / ω<sub>motor,max</sub></em>, or nominally, drive output frequency divided by maximum output frequency, if motor slip is ignored).</p>
<p>To make use of the available data, the Stein and Hydeman linear correlation must intrinsically make an assumption that motor speed and torque have some fixed relationship. Although not documented, their assumption might be the common belief that fractional torque (τ/ τ<sub>max</sub>) for a motor is simply the square of its fractional speed. For fans serving duct systems with components such as filters and coils, with relatively low pressure drops elsewhere in the system, and for systems that have a non-zero controlled duct static pressure, this assumption may be inappropriate. Consequently, to make use of the available data and to avoid such assumptions, one needs to know the fraction of full speed at which fan components operate.</p>
<p>For the fan, dimensionless flow (<em>φ</em>) can be defined as (ASHRAE 1993):</p>
<div img="image4900.txt">\(\varphi  = \frac{{{Q_{fan}}}}{{{\omega_{fan}} \cdot D_{fan}^3}}\)</div>

<p>()</p>
<p>where <em>ω<sub>fan</sub></em> is the fan speed (rad/s). This parameter can be calculated for each operating point on the fan manufacturer’s performance map that represents fan speed as a function of flow and fan pressure rise. To simplify the data representation to a single curve (as we have done for fan efficiency), one can plot normalized dimensionless flow (dimensionless flow divided by maximum dimensionless flow, (<em>φ</em>(<em>x<sub>fan</sub></em>) <em>/</em> <em>φ<sub>max</sub></em>) as a function of the log base 10 of the normalized Euler (<em>Eu</em>) parameter (<em>x<sub>fan</sub></em>). Figure 211 shows an example plot derived from the manufacturer’s data in Figure 208.</p>

<p>For any operating point of flow (<em>Q<sub>fan</sub></em>) and fan pressure rise (<strong>Δ</strong><em>P<sub>fan</sub></em>), one can calculate the corresponding Euler number (<em>Eu</em>) for the given fan, and then determine the corresponding normalized dimensionless flow (<em>φ</em>(<em>x<sub>fan</sub></em>) <em>/</em> <em>φ<sub>max</sub></em>) from the sigmoidal dimensionless flow function (Equation ). With <em>φ</em>(<em>x<sub>fan</sub></em>) <em>/</em> <em>φ<sub>max</sub></em> determined and knowing <em>φ<sub>max</sub></em> for the fan, the dimensionless flow is:</p>

<p>The fraction of full-load driven torque for the belt (<em>τ<sub>fan</sub> / τ<sub>belt,max</sub></em>), which is typically called “belt load”, is thus <em>τ<sub>fan</sub></em> divided by the belt torque capacity (<em>τ<sub>belt,max</sub></em>).

<p>Ignoring belt slip, motor shaft speed (<em>ω<sub>motor</sub></em>, rad/s) can then be determined using the fan speed (<em>ω<sub>fan</sub></em>) and the motor/fan pulley diameter ratio (<em>D<sub>pulley,motor</sub> / D<sub>pulley,fan</sub></em>), which is typically called the “drive” ratio:</p>

<p><em>Belt, Motor, and Variable-Frequency-Drive Efficiency and Input Power Models – Overview</em>: The models for belt drives, motors, and VFDs that Stein and Hydeman included in their air-handling system model represent maximum efficiency as a function of power input to the adjacent downstream component (e.g., the power input to a fan shaft by a belt drive), but they do not include part-load models. The part-load models are needed, because part-load efficiency for these components can fall off rapidly at low load (e.g., to zero at zero load) and many systems operate occasionally (and some much of the time) at low loads, in part because of current practices that result in substantial oversizing of components.</p>
<p><em>Belt Efficiency and Input Power Model:</em> Figure 212 shows three maximum efficiency (<em>η<sub>belt,max</sub></em>) curves for belts (low, medium, and high) as a function of maximum fan shaft torque. This set of efficiency curves is based on belt drive loss data from AMCA Publication 203 (1990b), which reportedly is an aggregation of data from over 400 tests.</p>
<p>To determine <em>η<sub>belt,max</sub></em> if data for a specific belt are not available, first use the maximum fan shaft input power (<em>H<sub>fan,max</sub></em>) for the load spectrum to calculate the natural logarithm of belt power capacity:</p>

<h4 id="overview_4">Overview</h4>
<p>The input object AirLoopHVAC:UnitarySystem provide a “virtual” component that collect and control a set of components: fan, heating coil, cooling coil, and/or reheat coil. Reheat coil is modeled for controlling high zone humidity levels. The unit may be configured to have either a blow through or draw through fan. In a blow through configuration, fan is generally the fist component upstream of heating ro cooling coil. In a draw through fan configuration, fan is placed directly after the heating coil and before reheat coil.</p>

<p>Figure 218. Schematic of the EnergyPlus Unitary System (Blow Through Configuration)</p>
<h4 id="model-description_3">Model Description</h4>
<p>As described previously, the unitary system is a “virtual” component consisting of a fan, heating coil, cooling coil and reheat coil. The sole purpose of the unitary system model is to properly coordinate the operation of the various system components. The following sections describe the flow of information within the model, as well as the differences between cycling and continuous supply air fan operation.</p>
<h4 id="controls">Controls</h4>
<p>There are two types of control types allowed to be specified in the unitary system which are setpoint based and load based. Each control type is described in detail below.</p>
<p>Setpoint based control:</p>
<p>The unitary system calculates the current sensible load using the temperature of the inlet node and the System Node Setpoint Temp on the control node. If the control node is not the outlet node, the desired outlet node temperature is adjusted for the current temperature difference between the outlet node and the control node. Likewise, the current latent load is calculated using the humidity ratio of the inlet node and the System Node Humidity Ratio Max on the control node. The controls determine the required coil run-time fraction and dehumidification mode (if applicable) using the steps outlined below.</p>
<h5 id="step-1-meet-sensible-load-requirement">Step 1 – Meet Sensible Load Requirement</h5>
<p>The controls first attempt to meet the sensible requirement. The specified coil model is called with a part-load ratio (PLR) of 1.0 to determine the full-load output of the coil. This is compared with the desired outlet node temperature and a sensible PLR is calculated. If the PLR is &lt;1.0, a Regula-Falsi iteration routine is called to determine the coil run-time fraction which results in the desired outlet node temperature. For a variable-speed DX cooling coil, if the load is smaller than the sensible capacity at the lowest speed, the coil run-time fraction is determined in the same way as a single-speed DX cooling coil. Otherwise, its speed number and speed ratio between two neighboring speeds are selected to match the load.</p>
<h5 id="step-2-meet-latent-load-requirement-if-activated">Step 2 – Meet Latent Load Requirement (if activated)</h5>
<p>If dehumidification controls are active, the leaving humidity ratio resulting from operation to meet the sensible load (Step 1 above) is compared with the desired outlet node humidity ratio. If the humidity requirement is already met, then no further control action is taken. If the humidity requirement has not been met, then the coil is re-simulated depending on the type of humidity control.</p>
<h5 id="step-2a-humidity-control-multimode">Step 2a – Humidity Control = MultiMode</h5>
<p>If the humidity control type is MultiMode, then the coil's enhanced dehumidification mode is activated when the coil type is Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoStageWithHumidityControlMode and Step 1 above is repeated to meet the sensible load using the coil performance resulting from the enhanced dehumidificaiton mode. This is a semi-passive approach to dehumidification which may fall short or may exceed the dehumidification requirement.</p>
<h5 id="step-2b-humidity-control-coolreheat">Step 2b – Humidity Control = CoolReheat</h5>
<p>If the humidity control type is CoolReheat, the coil is re-simulated to achieve the desired outlet node humidity ratio. This option is valid for all cooling coil types. When the coil type is Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoStageWithHumidityControlMode, only the cooling performance mode is used for this step and enhanced dehumidification mode is not activated.</p>
<p>Load based control:</p>
<p>While the unitary system may be configured to serve multiple zones, system operation is controlled by a thermostat located in a single “control” zone. One of the key parameters for the unitary system component is the fraction of the total system air flow that goes through the control zone. This fraction is calculated as the ratio of the maximum air mass flow rate for the air loop’s supply inlet node for the control zone (e.g., AirTerminal:SingleDuct:Uncontrolled, field = Maximum Air Flow Rate, converted to mass flow) to the sum of the maximum air mass flow rates for the air loop’s supply inlet nodes for all zones served by this air loop. The unitary system module scales the calculated load for the control zone upward based on this fraction to determine the total load to be met by the unitary system. The module then proceeds to calculate the required part-load ratio for the system coil and the supply air fan to meet this total load. The heating or cooling capacity delivered by the unitary system is distributed to all of the zones served by this system via the terminal units that supply air to each zone. The supply air fraction that goes though the control zone is calculated as follows:</p>
<div>\[Control Zone Air Flow\,Fraction = \frac{{{{\dot m}_{TUMax\,ControlZone}}}}{{\sum\limits_{j = 1}^{NumOfZones} {{{\dot m}_{TUMax\,Zone\,j}}} }}\]</div>

<p>where:</p>
<div img="image4932.txt">\({\dot m_{TUMax\,ControlledZone}}\)</div>

<p>=    maximum air mass flow rate for the air loop’s supply inlet node (terminal unit) for the control zone (kg/s)</p>
<div img="image4933.txt">\({\dot m_{TUMax\,Zone\,j}}\)</div>

<p>=    maximum air mass flow rate for the air loop’s supply inlet node for the jth zone (kg/s)</p>
<div img="image4934.txt">\(NumOfZones\)</div>

<p>=    number of zones, or number of air loop supply air inlet nodes for all zones served by the air loop (-)</p>
<p>The unitary system component is able to model supply air fan operation in two modes: cycling fan – cycling coil (i.e., AUTO fan) and continuous fan – cycling coil (i.e., fan ON). Fan:OnOff must be used to model AUTO fan, while Fan:OnOff or Fan:ConstantVolume can be used to model fan ON. The fan operation mode is specified using a supply air fan operating mode schedule where schedule values of 0 denote cycling fan operation and schedule values other than 0 (a 1 is usually used) denote continuous fan operation. Using this schedule, the unitary system fan may be cycled with cooling or heating coil operation or operated continuously based on time of day (e.g., cycling fan operation at night and continuous fan operation during the daytime). If the fan operating mode schedule name field is left blank in the unitary system object, the unitary system assumes cycling or AUTO fan mode operation throughout the simulation.</p>
<p>The unitary system operates based on the user-specified (or autosized) design supply air flow rate(s). The ‘design’ supply air mass flow rate may be different for cooling, heating, and when no cooling or heating is required and the fan operates continuously based on user-specified inputs.</p>
<p><strong>Cooling Operation</strong></p>
<p>If EnergyPlus determines that the unitary system must supply cooling to the control zone to meet the zone air temperature setpoint, then the model computes the total sensible cooling load to be met by the unitary system based on the control zone sensible cooling load and the fraction of the unitary system air flow that goes through the control zone.</p>
<div>\[UnitarySystemCoolingLoad = \frac{{ControlZoneCoolingLoad}}{{ControlZoneAirFlowFraction}}\]</div>

<p>If the supply air fan operating mode schedule requests cycling fan operation, the model first checks for the presence of an ecomomizer in the outside air system serving the unitary system’s air loop (Ref. AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem). If an outside air system is not present or if an air-side economizer is not used, the unitary system’s compressor is used to meet the unitary system cooling load. If an air-side economizer is used and is active (i.e., economizer controls indicate that conditions are favorable to increase the outside air flow rate), the unitary system will try to meet the cooling load by operating only the supply air fan. If the fan is able to satisfy the unitary system cooling load, the compressor remains off for the entire simulation time step. If the operation of the fan alone is unable to meet the entire cooling load, then the compressor is enabled and additional calculations are performed to determine the compressor’s part-load ratio.</p>
<p>The model then calculates the unitary system’s sensible cooling energy rate delivered to the zones being served when the system runs at full-load conditions and when the cooling coil is OFF. If the supply air fan cycles with the compressor, then the sensible cooling energy rate is zero when the cooling coil is OFF. However if the fan is configured to run continuously regardless of coil operation, then the sensible cooling energy rate will probably not be zero when the cooling coil is OFF. Calculating the sensible cooling energy rate involves modeling the supply air fan (and associated fan heat), the cooling coil, and the heating and reheat coil (simply to pass the air properties and mass flow rate from its inlet node to its outlet node). For each of these cases (full load and cooling coil OFF), the sensible cooling energy rate delivered by the unitary system is calculated as follows:</p>
<div>\[Full\;Cool\;Output = (Mass\;Flow\;Rat{e_{ful\;load}}){({h_{out,full\;load}} - {h_{control\;zone}})_{HR\min }} - {\Delta_{sen,\;full\;load}}\]</div>

<div>\[No\;Cool\;Output = (Mass\;Flow\;Rat{e_{coil\;off}}){({h_{out,\;coil\;off}} - {h_{control\;zone}})_{HR\min }} - {\Delta_{sen,\;coil\;off}}\]</div>

<p>where:</p>
<p><em>Mass Flow Rate<sub>full\ load</sub></em> = air mass flow rate through unitary system at full-load conditions, kg/s</p>
<p><em>h<sub>out,\ full\ load</sub></em> = enthalpy of air exiting the unitary system at full-load conditions, J/kg</p>

<p>Δ<sub>sen,</sub> <em><sub>full\ load</sub></em>=Sensible load difference between the system output node and the zone inlet node at full-load conditions</p>
<div>\[\begin{array}{l}{\Delta_{sen,\;full\;load}} = \frac{{Mass\;Flow\;Rat{e_{_{Zone\;Inlet}}}}}{{Frac}}{\left( {{h_{Out,\;full\;load}} - {h_{Zone\;Inlet}}} \right)_{HR\min }}\\\quad \quad \quad \quad  + \left( {Mass\;Flow\;Rat{e_{_{full\;load}}} - \frac{{Mass\;Flow\;Rat{e_{_{Zone\;Inlet}}}}}{{Frac}}} \right){\left( {{h_{Out,\;full\;load}} - {h_{_{Control\;Zone}}}} \right)_{HR\min }}\end{array}\]</div>

<p>where:</p>
<p>Frac = Control zone air fraction with respect to the system mass flow rate</p>
<p>Δ<sub>sen,coil\ off</sub>**=Sensible load difference between the system output node and the zone inlet node with the heating coil OFF conditions</p>
<div>\[\begin{array}{l}{\Delta_{sen,\;coil\;off}} = \frac{{Mass\;Flow\;Rat{e_{_{Zone\;Inlet}}}}}{{Frac}}{\left( {{h_{Out,\;coil\;off}} - {h_{Zone\;Inlet}}} \right)_{HR\min }}\\\quad \quad \quad \quad  + \left( {Mass\;Flow\;Rat{e_{_{coil\;off}}} - \frac{{Mass\;Flow\;Rat{e_{_{Zone\;Inlet}}}}}{{Frac}}} \right){\left( {{h_{Out,\;coil\;off}} - {h_{_{Control\;Zone}}}} \right)_{HR\min }}\end{array}\]</div>

<p>With the calculated sensible cooling energy rates and the total sensible cooling load to be met by the system, the part-load ratio for the unitary system is estimated.</p>
<div>\[PartLoadRatio = MAX\left( {0.0,\frac{{\left( {UnitarySystemCoolingLoad - NoCoolOutput} \right)}}{{\left( {FullCoolOutput - NoCoolOutput} \right)}}} \right)\]</div>

<p>Since the part-load performance of the cooling coil is frequently non-linear, and the supply air fan heat varies based on cooling coil operation for the case of cycling fan/cycling coil (AUTO fan), the final part-load ratio for the cooling coil compressor and fan are determined through iterative calculations (successive modeling of the cooling coil and fan) until the unitary system’s cooling output matches the cooling load to be met within the convergence tolerance. The convergence tolerance is fixed at 0.001 and is calculated based on the difference between the load to be met and the unitary system’s cooling output divided by the load to be met.</p>
<div>\[Tolerance = 0.001 \ge \frac{{\left( {UnitarySystemCoolingLoad - {Q_{UnitarySystem}}} \right)}}{{UnitarySystemCoolingLoad}}\]</div>

<p>where:</p>
<div img="image4942.txt">\({Q_{UnitarySystem}}\)</div>

<p>= Unitary system delivered sensible capacity (W)</p>
<p>If the unitary system has been specified with cycling fan/cycling coil (AUTO fan), then the unitary system’s operating supply air mass flow rate is multiplied by PartLoadRatio to determine the average air mass flow rate for the system simulation time step. In this case, the air conditions at nodes downstream of the cooling coil represent the full-load (steady-state) values when the coil is operating.</p>
<p>If the fan operates continuously (i.e., when the supply air fan operating mode schedule values are NOT equal to 0), the operating air mass flow rate through the unitary system is calculated as the average of the user-specified air flow rate when the cooling coil is ON and the user-specified air flow rate when the cooling coil is OFF (user-specified supply air volumetric flow rates converted to dry air mass flow rates).</p>
<div>\[{\mathop m\limits^ \bullet_{UnitarySystem}} = PartLoadRatio\left( {{{\mathop m\limits^ \bullet  }_{CoolCoilON}}} \right) + \left( {1 - PartLoadRatio} \right)\left( {{{\mathop m\limits^ \bullet  }_{CoilOFF}}} \right)\]</div>

<p>where:</p>
<div img="image4944.txt">\(\mathop m\limits^ \bullet  CoolCoilON\)</div>

<p>= air mass flow rate through unitary system when the cooling coil is ON (kg/s)</p>
<div img="image4945.txt">\(\mathop m\limits^ \bullet  CoilOFF\)</div>

<p>= air mass flow rate through unitary system when no cooling or heating is needed (kg/s)</p>
<p>In this case, the air conditions at nodes downstream of the cooling coil are calculated as the average conditions over the simulation time step (i.e., the weighted average of full-load conditions when the coil is operating and inlet air conditions when the coil is OFF).</p>
<p><strong>Cooling Operation (multi or variable speed coils)</strong></p>
<p>After the unitary system cooling load is determined as described in Eq. above, the multi or variable speed cooling coil models calculations are described in this section.</p>
<p>The model calculates the unitary system’s sensible cooling energy rate delivered to the zones being served when the system runs at full-load conditions at the highest speed and when the DX cooling coil is OFF. If the supply air fan cycles with the compressor, then the sensible cooling energy rate is zero when the cooling coil is OFF. However if the fan is scheduled to run continuously regardless of coil operation, then the sensible cooling energy rate will not be zero when the cooling coil is OFF. Calculating the sensible cooling energy rate involves modeling the supply air fan (and associated fan heat) and the multi/variable speed DX cooling coil. The multi/variable speed DX heating coil and the supplemental heating coil are also modeled, but only to pass the air properties and mass flow rate from their inlet nodes to their outlet nodes. For each of these cases (full load at highest cooling speed and DX cooling coil OFF), the sensible cooling energy rate delivered by the unitary system is calculated as follows:</p>
<div img="image4946.txt">\(FullCoolOutpu{t_{Highest\;Speed}} = ({\dot m_{HighestSpeed}}){({h_{out,full\;load}} - {h_{control\;zone}})_{HR\min }} - {\Delta_{sen,\;HighestSpeed}}\)</div>

<p>If the unitary system’s sensible cooling rate at the highest speed (full load, no cycling) is insufficient to meet the entire cooling load, the controlled zone conditions will not be met. The reported cycling rate and speed ratio are 1, and the speed number is set to the highest index number. If the total sensible cooling load to be met by the system is less than the sensible cooling rate at the highest speed, then the following steps are performed.</p>
<p>·        Calculate the sensible cooling energy rate at Speed 1</p>

<p>Speed 1 operation</p>
<p>If the unitary system has been specified with cycling fan/cycling coil (AUTO fan), then the unitary system’s operating supply air mass flow rate is determined by the cycling ratio (PartLoadRatio) for Speed 1.

<p><strong>Heating Operation</strong></p>
<p>Calculations for heating operation are similar to those for cooling operation in most respects. However, due to the inclusion of a supplemental heating coil, additional calculations are necessary to properly meet the total heating load for the zones being served.</p>
<p>If EnergyPlus determines that the unitary system must supply heating to the control zone to meet the zone air temperature setpoint, then the unitary system model computes the total sensible heating load to be delivered to the zones being served based on the control zone sensible heating load and the control zone airflow fraction.</p>
<div>\[UnitarySystemHeatingLoad = \frac{{ControlZoneHeatingLoad}}{{ControlZoneAirFlowFraction}}\]</div>

<p>The model then calculates the unitary system’s sensible heating energy rate delivered to the zones being served when the system runs at full-load conditions and when the heating coil is OFF (without supplemental heater operation in either case). If the supply air fan cycles with the compressor, then the sensible heating energy rate is zero when the compressor is OFF. However if the fan is scheduled to run continuously regardless of coil operation, then the sensible heating energy rate will not be zero when the compressor is OFF. Calculating the sensible heating energy rate involves modeling the supply air fan (and associated fan heat), the  cooling coil (simply to pass the air properties and mass flow rate from its inlet node to its outlet node), the  heating coil, and the supplemental heating coil (simply to pass the air properties and mass flow rate from its inlet node to its outlet node).

<h4 id="high-humidity-control">High Humidity Control</h4>
<p>The specific configuration of the unitary system with supplemental heating coil is shown above (see Figure 227). This figure shows the fan placement when a blow through fan is specified. If a draw through fan is specified, the fan is located between the heating coil and the supplemental heating coil. The system is controlled to keep the high relative humidity in the control zone from exceeding the setpoint specified in the object ZoneControl:Humidistat. This option is available when the supply air fan operates continuously (i.e., the supply air fan operating mode schedule values are never equal to 0) or the supply air fan cycles with the compressor. In addition, when high humidity control is specified and the compressor operates, the unitary system operates at the cooling air flow rate when a zone heating load is present as determined by the zone thermostat. High humidity control is specified as either None, MultiMode, or CoolReheat in the Dehumidification Control Type input field. MultiMode is specified when a heat exchanger is used to improve the dehumidification performance of the cooling coil. The heat exchanger will be activated when the sensible part-load ratio is insufficient to meet the zone latent load. CoolReheat is specified when a cooling coil is used to over-cool the supply air stream in order to meet the zone latent load. In this case, a supplemental heating coil will ensure the zone temperature does not fall below the zone heating temperature set point. When a heat exchanger is used in conjunction with a cooling coil and CoolReheat is specified as the Dehumidification Control Type, the heat exchanger is “locked on” to meet either the sensible or latent cooling load. If the dehumidification control type is selected as None and a heat exchanger assisted cooling coil is used, the heat exchanger is “locked on” and the air conditioner runs only to meet the sensible cooling load. A supplemental heating coil is required for all dehumidification control types.</p>
<p>The model first calculates the <em>PartLoadRatio</em> required to meet the sensible cooling load.  The unitary system’s sensible cooling load is determined from the control zone sensible cooling load to the cooling setpoint and the control zone air flow fraction to maintain the dry-bulb temperature setpoint in the control zone.:</p>

<div>\[PartLoadRatio = MAX\left( {0.0,\frac{{\left( {UnitarySystemCoolingLoad - NoCoolOutput} \right)}}{{\left( {FullCoolOutput - NoCoolOutput} \right)}}} \right)\]</div>

<p>hen the unitary system’s sensible cooling capacity meets the system sensible cooling load at a given sensible part load ratio, then the Unitary system meets the controlled zone cooling setpoint temperature. If a moisture (latent) load exists because the control zone humidity has exceeded the setpoint, the total moisture load to be met by the unitary systems (Unitary systemMoistureLoad) is calculated based on the control zone moisture load and the control zone air flow fraction.</p>
<div>\[UnitarySystemMoistureLoad = \frac{{ControlZoneMoistureLoad}}{{ControlZoneAirFlowFraction}}\]</div>

<p>Then the <em>LatentPartLoadRatio</em> required to meet the high humidity setpoint is calculated as follows:</p>

<p>When the predicted zone air temperature is above the heating setpoint and if there is a dehumidification load, the supplemental heating coil load is required to offset the excess cooling as shown in Figure 228. If the model determines that the LatentPartLoadRatio is to be used as the operating part-load ratio of the unitary system’s cooling coil, the supplemental heating coil is used to offset the excess sensible capacity provided by the unitary system cooling coil. The model first checks the sensible load that exists for the current simulation time step (predicted zone temperature with no HVAC operation compared to the thermostat setpoint temperatures). If a sensible cooling load or no sensible cooling or heating load exists, the model calculates the difference between the sensible heating load required to reach or maintain the heating dry-bulb temperature setpoint and the actual sensible cooling energy rate delivered by the unit (with LatentPartLoadRatio). In this case, thesupplemental heating coil is used to offset the excess sensible cooling energy provided by the cooling coil (if any) that could have caused an overshoot of the heating dry-bulb temperature setpoint. Note that when a humidistat is used and high humidity control is required, the zone dry-bulb temperature will typically move toward the heating temperature setpoint when a high moisture (latent) load exists.</p>

<p>If a heating load exists (Figure 229), the supplementalheating coil is used to meet the heating coil load and at the same time offset the entire sensible cooling energy rate of the cooling coil (to meet the humidistat setpoint).

<h4 id="overview_5">Overview</h4>
<p>The input objects AirLoopHVAC:Unitary:Furnace:HeatOnly and AirLoopHVAC:Unitary:Furnace:HeatCool provide a “virtual” component that collect and control a set of components:  an on/off or constant volume fan component and a gas or electric heating coil component. If the HeatCool version is selected, then a DX cooling coil is also modeled as part of the system as shown in Figure 221 below. For the HeatCool version, an optional reheat coil may also be modeled for controlling high zone humidity levels and the furnace’s configuration when specifying this option is shown in Figure 222 below. The unit may be configured to have either a blow through or draw through fan. If a blow through fan configuration is specified, the furnace fan is placed before the heating coil for the HeatOnly version, or before the cooling coil for the HeatCool version as shown in the figure below. If a draw through fan configuration is specified, the fan is placed directly after the heating coil.</p>
<p>Note: the coil order shown here has been revised from previous versions of Energyplus to configure the cooling coil upstream of the heating coil. This configuration provides uniformity with all unitary equipment. However, for unitary HeatCool systems that do not use a reheat coil, the heating coil can also be placed upstream of the cooling coil. This optional coil placement is retained to allow compatibility with previous versions of Energyplus. For input files developed using previous versions of Energyplus, it is recommended that the coil order be revised according to the figure below.</p>
<p><img alt="FurnaceSchematic_BlowThru" src="../../EngineeringReference/media/image5019.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 221. Schematic of the EnergyPlus Furnace (Blow Through Configuration)</p>
<p>While the furnace may be configured to serve multiple zones, system operation is controlled by a thermostat located in a single “control” zone. One of the key parameters for the furnace component is the fraction of the total system air flow that goes through the control zone. This fraction is calculated as the ratio of the maximum air mass flow rate for the air loop’s supply inlet node for the control zone (e.g., AirTerminal:SingleDuct:Uncontrolled, field = Maximum Air Flow Rate, converted to mass flow) to the sum of the maximum air mass flow rates for the air loop’s supply inlet nodes for all zones served by this air loop. The furnace module scales the calculated load for the control zone upward based on this fraction to determine the total load to be met by the furnace. The module then proceeds to calculate the required part-load ratio for the system coil and the supply air fan to meet this total load. The heating or cooling capacity delivered by the furnace is distributed to all of the zones served by this system via the terminal units that supply air to each zone. The supply air fraction that goes though the control zone is calculated as follows:</p>
<div>\[Control Zone Air Flow\,Fraction = \frac{{{{\dot m}_{TUMax\,ControlZone}}}}{{\sum\limits_{j = 1}^{NumOfZones} {{{\dot m}_{TUMax\,Zone\,j}}} }}\]</div>

<p>where:</p>
<div img="image5021.txt">\({\dot m_{TUMax\,ControlledZone}}\)</div>

<p>=    maximum air mass flow rate for the air loop’s supply inlet node (terminal unit) for the control zone (kg/s)</p>
<div img="image5022.txt">\({\dot m_{TUMax\,Zone\,j}}\)</div>

<p>=    maximum air mass flow rate for the air loop’s supply inlet node for the jth zone (kg/s)</p>
<div img="image5023.txt">\(NumOfZones\)</div>

<p>=    number of zones, or number of air loop supply air inlet nodes for all zones served by the air loop (-)</p>
<p>The furnace component is able to model supply air fan operation in two modes: cycling fan – cycling coil (i.e., AUTO fan) and continuous fan – cycling coil (i.e., fan ON). Fan:OnOff must be used to model AUTO fan, while Fan:OnOff or Fan:ConstantVolume can be used to model fan ON. The fan operation mode is specified using a supply air fan operating mode schedule where schedule values of 0 denote cycling fan operation and schedule values other than 0 (a 1 is usually used) denote continuous fan operation. Using this schedule, the furnace fan may be cycled with cooling or heating coil operation or operated continuously based on time of day (e.g., cycling fan operation at night and continuous fan operation during the daytime). If the fan operating mode schedule name field is left blank in the furnace object, the furnace assumes cycling or AUTO fan mode operation throughout the simulation.</p>
<p>The only output variables reported by the furnace object are the fan part-load ratio and the compressor part-load ratio (HeatCool only). The fan part-load ratio is defined as the actual air mass flow rate through the system for the time step divided by the design supply air mass flow rate specified for the furnace (<div img="image5024.txt">({{{{\dot m}<em>{actual}}} \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{{{\dot m}</em>{actual}}} {{{\dot m}<em>{design}}}}} \right. } {{{\dot m}</em>{design}}}})</div>)..The furnace operates based on the user-specified (or autosized) design supply air flow rate(s). The ‘design’ supply air mass flow rate may be different for cooling, heating, and when no cooling or heating is required and the fan operates continuously based on user-specified inputs (HeatCool only). For the HeatCool version, If alternate air flow rates are specified for cooling, heating, and when no cooling or heating is required, the design supply air mass flow rate is the maximum of these specified values. Also for the HeatCool version, the compressor part-load ratio is reported as the ratio of the actual cooling load to the full-load sensible capacity (see Eqn. ). Reporting of other variables of interest for the furnace (heating rate, cooling rate, energy consumption, etc.) is done by the individual system components (fan, heating coil and DX cooling coil).</p>
<h4 id="model-description_4">Model Description</h4>
<p>As described previously, the furnace is a “virtual” component consisting of a fan, heating coil and, for the HeatCool version, a cooling coil with an optional reheat coil. The sole purpose of the furnace model is to properly coordinate the operation of the various system components. The following sections describe the flow of information within the model for both the HeatOnly and HeatCool configurations, as well as the differences between cycling and continuous supply air fan operation. The last section describes the optional control of high zone humidity with a reheat coil for the HeatCool configuration.</p>
<h4 id="heatonly-configuration">HeatOnly Configuration</h4>
<p>The HeatOnly configuration consists of an on/off or constant volume fan and an electric or gas heating coil. When the model is first called during an EnergyPlus simulation, all of the input data specified for each furnace in the input data file are read into data structures for use throughout the remainder of the simulation.</p>
<p>For each simulation time step when the performance of a heat-only furnace is being modeled, the first step is to retrieve the heating load required to meet the thermostat setpoint for the “control” zone (see Figure 221. Schematic of the EnergyPlus Furnace). See the section “Summary of Predictor-Corrector Procedure” elsewhere in this document for more details regarding load calculations. Since the furnace may be specified to serve several zones but controlled based on the load calculated for the “control” zone, the total heating load to be met by the furnace is determined from the following equation:</p>
<div>\[Furnace\,Heating\,Load\, = \frac{{Control\,Zone\,Heating\,Load}}{{Control\,Zone\,Air\,Flow\,Fraction}}\]</div>

<p>The model then calculates the furnace’s sensible heating energy rate delivered to the zones being served when the system runs at full-load conditions and when the heating coil is OFF. If the supply air fan cycles on and off with the heater, then the sensible heating energy rate is zero when the heating coil is OFF. However if the fan is scheduled to run continuously regardless of coil operation, then the sensible heating energy rate will not be zero when the heating coil is OFF. Calculating the sensible heating energy rate involves modeling the supply air fan (and associated fan heat) and the heating coil. For each of these cases (full load and heating coil OFF), the sensible heating energy rate delivered by the furnace is calculated as follows:</p>
<div>\[Full\;Heat\;Output = (Mass\;Flow\;Rat{e_{ful\;load}}){({h_{out,full\;load}} - {h_{control\;zone}})_{HR\min }} - {\Delta_{sen,\;full\;load}}\]</div>

<div>\[No\;Heat\;Output = (Mass\;Flow\;Rat{e_{coil\;off}}){({h_{out,\;coil\;off}} - {h_{control\;zone}})_{HR\min }} - {\Delta_{sen,\;coil\;off}}\]</div>

<p>where:</p>
<p><em>Mass Flow Rate<sub>full\ load</sub></em> = air mass flow rate through furnace at full-load conditions, kg/s</p>
<p><em>h<sub>out,\ full\ load</sub></em> = enthalpy of air exiting the furnace at full-load conditions, J/kg</p>

<p>With the calculated sensible heating energy rates and the total sensible heating load to be met by the system, the part-load ratio for the furnace is estimated.</p>
<div>\[PartLoadRatio\, = \,MAX\left( {0.0,MIN\left( {1.0,\frac{{ABS\left( {FurnaceHeatingLoad - NoHeatOutput} \right)}}{{ABS(FullHeatOutput - NoHeatOutput)}}} \right)} \right)\]</div>

<p>The part-load ratio calculated above is used to determine the required heating coil capacity as <div img="image5031.txt">(Qheating\,coil = Qdesign\,<em>PartLoadRatio)</div> where </em>Q<sub>design</sub>* is the nominal heating coil capacity as specified in the heating coil object. If the fan cycles on and off with the heating coil (i.e.,  when the supply air fan operating mode schedule values are equal to 0), then this part-load ratio is also used to determine the operating mass flow rate of the furnace as</p>
<div>\[{\dot m_{furnace}} = {\dot m_{design}}*PartLoadRatio\]</div>

<p>If the fan operates continuously (i.e. fan ON), the operating mass flow rate is specified as <div img="image5033.txt">({\dot m_{design}})</div>. The furnace’s fan and heating coil are then re-simulated to determine the furnace’s delivered sensible heating capacity at the above calculated part-load ratio.</p>
<div>\[{Q_{furnace}} = \left( {{{\dot m}_{furnace}}} \right){\left( {{h_{out,actual}} - {h_{control\;zone}}} \right)_{HR\min }} - {\Delta_{sen,\;actual}}\]</div>

<div>\[\begin{array}{l}{\Delta_{sen,\;actual}} = \frac{{Mass\;Flow\;Rat{e_{_{Zone\;Inlet}}}}}{{Frac}}{\left( {{h_{Out,\;actual}} - {h_{Zone\;Inlet}}} \right)_{HR\min }}\\\quad \quad \quad \quad  + \left( {{{\dot m}_{furnace}} - \frac{{Mass\;Flow\;Rat{e_{_{Zone\;Inlet}}}}}{{Frac}}} \right){\left( {{h_{Out,\;actual}} - {h_{_{Control\;Zone}}}} \right)_{HR\min }}\end{array}\]</div>

<p>Since the part-load performance of the heating coil can be non-linear, and the supply air fan heat varies based on heating coil operation for the case of cycling fan/cycling coil (AUTO fan), the final part-load ratio for the heating coil and fan are determined through iterative calculations (successive modeling of the heating coil and fan) until the furnace’s heating output matches the heating load to be met within the heating convergence tolerance. The convergence tolerance is fixed at 0.001 and is calculated based on the difference between the load to be met and the furnace’s heating output divided by the load to be met.</p>
<div>\[Tolerance = {\raise0.7ex\hbox{${\left( {FurnaceHeatingLoad - {Q_{furnace}}} \right)}$} \!\mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{\left( {FurnaceHeatingLoad - {Q_{furnace}}} \right)} {FurnaceHeatingLoad}}}\right.}\!\lower0.7ex\hbox{${FurnaceHeatingLoad}$}} = 0.001\]</div>

<p>If the furnace has been specified with cycling fan/cycling coil (AUTO fan), then the furnace’s design air mass flow rate is multiplied by PartLoadRatio to determine the average air mass flow rate for the system simulation time step. The air conditions at nodes downstream of the heating coil represent the full-load (steady-state) values when the coil is operating. If the supply air fan is specified to run continuously (fan ON), then the air mass flow rate remains at the furnace’s design air mass flow rate. In this case, the air conditions at nodes downstream of the heating coil are calculated as the average conditions over the simulation time step (i.e., the weighted average of full-load conditions when the coil is operating and inlet air conditions when the coil is OFF).</p>
<p>For the case where the furnace is scheduled to operate with continuous supply air fan operation, but no heating load is required to meet the setpoint temperature in the control zone, the supply air fan model is still called to determine the fan exiting air conditions. The heating coil model is also called, but for the case with no heating load the heating coil model simply passes the inlet air conditions and mass flow rate from its inlet node to its outlet node. The air exiting the heating coil is then sent to the direct air units for distribution to each zone served by the furnace, where the zone heat balance is performed to determine the resulting zone air conditions. The furnace exiting air conditions and energy consumption are calculated and reported by the individual component models (fan and heating coil).</p>
<h4 id="heatcool-configuration">HeatCool Configuration</h4>
<p>The HeatCool configuration consists of an on/off or constant volume fan, a DX cooling coil, and an electric or gas heating coil. For the cases where a heating load is calculated for the control zone or no heating/cooling load is calculated for the control zone, the model follows nearly identical computational steps as described in the HeatOnly Configuration section above. The only difference is the air mass flow rate during no cooling/heating operation with continuous supply air fan operation can be different from the air mass flow rate during heater operation for the HeatCool configuration. If a cooling load is calculated by EnergyPlus for the control zone, the solution methodology is also virtually identical and is described here for completeness.</p>
<p>If EnergyPlus determines that the furnace must supply cooling to the control zone to meet the zone air temperature setpoint, then the model computes the total sensible cooling load to be met by the furnace based on the control zone sensible cooling load and the fraction of the furnace air flow that goes through the control zone.</p>
<div>\[Furnace\,Cooling\,Load\, = \frac{{Control\,Zone\,Cooling\,Load}}{{Control\,Zone\,Air\,Flow\,Fraction}}\]</div>

<p>If the supply air fan operating mode schedule requests cycling fan operation, the model first checks for the presence of an ecomomizer in the outside air system serving the furnace’s air loop (Ref. AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem). If an outside air system is not present or if an air-side economizer is not used, the furnace’s compressor is used to meet the furnace cooling load. If an air-side economizer is used and is active (i.e., economizer controls indicate that conditions are favorable to increase the outside air flow rate), the furnace will try to meet the cooling load by operating only the supply air fan. If the fan is able to satisfy the furnace cooling load, the compressor remains off for the entire simulation time step. If the operation of the fan alone is unable to meet the entire cooling load, then the compressor is enabled and additional calculations are performed to determine the compressor’s part-load ratio.</p>
<p>The model then calculates the furnace’s sensible cooling energy rate delivered to the zones being served when the system runs at full-load conditions and when the DX cooling coil is OFF. If the supply air fan cycles with the compressor, then the sensible cooling energy rate is zero when the cooling coil is OFF. However if the fan is configured to run continuously regardless of coil operation, then the sensible cooling energy rate will probably not be zero when the cooling coil is OFF. Calculating the sensible cooling energy rate involves modeling the supply air fan (and associated fan heat), the DX cooling coil, and the heating coil (simply to pass the air properties and mass flow rate from its inlet node to its outlet node). For each of these cases (full load and DX cooling coil OFF), the sensible cooling energy rate delivered by the furnace is calculated as follows:</p>
<div>\[Full\;Cool\;Output = (Mass\;Flow\;Rat{e_{ful\;load}}){({h_{out,full\;load}} - {h_{control\;zone}})_{HR\min }} - {\Delta_{sen,\;full\;load}}\]</div>

<div>\[No\;Cool\;Output = (Mass\;Flow\;Rat{e_{coil\;off}}){({h_{out,\;coil\;off}} - {h_{control\;zone}})_{HR\min }} - {\Delta_{sen,\;coil\;off}}\]</div>

<p>= Furnace delivered sensible capacity (W)</p>
<p>If the furnace has been specified with cycling fan/cycling coil (AUTO fan) and high humidity control <em>has not</em> been specified, then the furnace’s operating supply air mass flow rate is multiplied by PartLoadRatio to determine the average air mass flow rate for the system simulation time step. The air conditions at nodes downstream of the cooling coil represent the full-load (steady-state) values when the coil is operating. If a cycling fan is used and high humidity control <em>has</em> been specified, the calculation of average air mass flow rate is based on the greater of the heating or cooling part-load ratio (see following section on high humidity control). When the heating part-load ratio is greater than the cooling part-load ratio, the air conditions at nodes downstream of the cooling coil represent the weighted average of full-load conditions when the cooling coil is operating and inlet air conditions when the cooling coil is off (i.e., the fan continues to operate due to a heating requirement where the heating PLR is greater than the cooling PLR). If the supply air fan is specified to run continuously (fan ON), then the air mass flow rate continues to operate at the user-specified supply air mass flow rate when no cooling or heating is required. In this case, the air conditions at nodes downstream of the cooling coil are calculated as the average conditions over the simulation time step (i.e., the weighted average of full-load conditions when the coil is operating and inlet air conditions when the coil is OFF). The furnace exiting air conditions and energy consumption are calculated and reported by the individual component models (fan and DX cooling coil).</p>
<h4 id="high-humidity-control-with-heatcool-configuration">High Humidity Control with HeatCool Configuration</h4>
<p>An optional reheat coil can be specified with the HeatCool configuration to allow the furnace to control high zone humidity levels. The specific configuration of the HeatCool Furnace with high humidity control option is shown in Figure 222. The figure below shows the fan placement when a blow through fan is specified. If a draw through fan is specified, the fan is located between the heating coil and the reheat coil. The system is controlled to keep the relative humidity in the control zone from exceeding the setpoint specified in the object ZoneControl:Humidistat. This option is available when the supply air fan operates continuously (i.e., the supply air fan operating mode schedule values are never equal to 0) or the supply air fan cycles with the compressor. For the case of cycling fan mode when the high humidity control is specified as CoolReheat <em>and</em> the heating part-load ratio is greater than the compressor part-load ratio, the air conditions at nodes downstream of the cooling coil are calculated as the average conditions during the duration of fan operation (i.e., the weighted average of full load conditions when the coil is operating and inlet air conditions when the coil is off and the fan continues to operate to meet the heating load). For the case where cycling fan mode is used <em>and</em> the heating part-load ratio is less than the compressor part-load ratio, the air conditions at the nodes downstream of the cooling coil are simply the full load (steady-state) values when the coil is operating. In addition, when high humidity control is specified and the compressor operates, the furnace operates at the cooling air flow rate when a zone heating load is present as determined by the zone thermostat.</p>
<p>High humidity control is specified as either None, MultiMode, or CoolReheat in the Dehumidification Control Type input field. MultiMode is specified when a heat exchanger is used to improve the dehumidification performance of the cooling coil. The heat exchanger will be activated when the sensible part-load ratio is insufficient to meet the zone latent load. CoolReheat is specified when a DX cooling coil is used to over-cool the supply air stream in order to meet the zone latent load. In this case, a reheat coil will ensure the zone temperature does not fall below the zone heating temperature set point. When a heat exchanger is used in conjunction with a DX cooling coil and CoolReheat is specified as the Dehumidification Control Type, the heat exchanger is “locked on” to meet either the sensible or latent cooling load. If the dehumidification control type is selected as None and a heat exchanger assisted cooling coil is used, the heat exchanger is “locked on” and the air conditioner runs only to meet the sensible cooling load. Although a reheat coil is required when CoolReheat is specified in the Dehumidification Control Type input field, this reheat coil may optionally be present for the other Dehumidification Control Types (e.g., None and Multimode). If the reheat coil is present and the dehumidification control type input is not specified as CoolReheat, the reheat coil will not be active. This allows changing the dehumidification control option without requiring a change in the unit’s coil configuration.</p>
<p>The model first calculates the PartLoadRatio required to meet the sensible cooling load as described above (see Eqn. ) to maintain the dry-bulb temperature setpoint in the control zone. If a moisture (latent) load exists because the control zone humidity has exceeded the setpoint, the total moisture load to be met by the HeatCool furnace (SystemMoistureLoad) is calculated based on the control zone moisture load and the control zone air flow fraction. The model then calculates the LatentPartLoadRatio required to meet the humidistat setpoint.</p>
<div>\[SystemMoistureLoad\, = \frac{{Control\,Zone\,Moisture\,Load}}{{Control\,Zone\,Air\,Flow\,Fraction}}\]</div>

<div>\[LatentPartLoadRatio\, = \,MAX\left( {MinPLR,\frac{{ABS\left( {SystemMoistureLoad - NoLatentOutput} \right)}}{{ABS\left( {FullLatentOutput - NoLatentOutput} \right)}}} \right)\]</div>

<p>where:</p>
<p><em>FullLatentOutput  </em>= the furnace’s latent cooling energy rate at full-load conditions, W</p>
<p><em>NoLatentOutput</em>     = the furnace’s latent cooling energy rate with the cooling coil OFF, W</p>
<p><em>MinPLR</em>                = the minimum part-load ratio, which is usually 0.0. For the case when the latent capacity degradation model is used (Ref: DX Cooling Coil Model), this value is the minimum part-load ratio at which the cooling coil will dehumidify the air.</p>
<p>The model uses the greater of the two part-load ratios, PartLoadRatio or LatentPartLoadRatio, to determine the operating part-load ratio of the furnace’s DX cooling coil. As previously described, iterations are performed to converge on the solution within the convergence tolerance.</p>
<p><img alt="FurnaceSchematic_BlowThru_HighRHControl" src="../../EngineeringReference/media/image5049.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 222. Schematic for Blow Through Furnace with High Humidity Control</p>
<p>If the model determines that the LatentPartLoadRatio is to be used as the operating part-load ratio of the furnace’s cooling coil, the reheat coil is used to offset the excess sensible capacity provided by the unit. The model first checks the sensible load that exists for the current simulation time step (predicted zone temperature with no HVAC operation compared to the thermostat setpoint temperatures). If a sensible cooling load or no sensible cooling or heating load exists (Figure 223), the model calculates the difference between the sensible heating load required to reach or maintain the heating dry-bulb temperature setpoint and the actual sensible cooling energy rate delivered by the unit (with LatentPartLoadRatio). In this case, the reheat coil is used to offset the excess sensible cooling energy provided by the DX cooling coil (if any) that could have caused an overshoot of the heating dry-bulb temperature setpoint. Note that when a humidistat is used and high humidity control is required, the zone dry-bulb temperature will typically move toward the heating temperature setpoint when a high moisture (latent) load exists. If a heating load exists (Figure 224), the reheat coil is used to offset the entire sensible cooling energy rate of the DX cooling coil (to meet the humidistat setpoint) and the heating coil is used to meet the entire heating load as described in the HeatOnly configuration section above. Note that when a heating load exists and high humidity control is required, the furnace operates at the user-specified cooling air flow rate for the entire simulation time step. As with the fan, DX cooling coil, and heating coil, report variables associated with reheat coil performance (e.g., heating coil energy, heating coil rate, heating coil gas or electric consumption, heating coil runtime fraction, etc.) are managed in the reheat (heating) coil object.</p>

<h3 id="unitary-system-with-changeover-bypass-variable-air-volume">Unitary System with Changeover-Bypass-Variable Air Volume</h3>
<h4 id="overview_6">Overview</h4>
<p>The input object AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool:VAVChangeoverBypass provides a model for a changeover-bypass variable air volume (CBVAV) unitary system that is a compound object made up of other components. Each CBVAV system consists of an outside air mixer, direct expansion (DX) cooling coil, heating coil, and a supply air fan as shown in the figures below. Zone thermostats and terminal units are required in each zone served by this system. The terminal units are specific to this system type and are either AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:HeatAndCool:Reheat or AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:HeatAndCool:NoReheat. A zone humidistat and single zone max humidity setpoint manager may also be specified to help control high humidity levels. These individual components are described elsewhere in this document. The CBVAV unitary system object coordinates the operation of these components and is modeled as a type of air loop equipment (Ref. AirLoopHVAC).</p>
<p><img alt="DrawthruCBVAV" src="../../EngineeringReference/media/image5052.png" /></p>

<p><img alt="BlowthruCBVAV" src="../../EngineeringReference/media/image5053.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 226. Schematic of Changeover Bypass VAV Unitary System with Blow Through Fan</p>
<p>The CBVAV unitary system conditions one or more zones and is controlled by thermostats located in each zone (the use of a single humidistat is also allowed when using multi-mode DX cooling coils). The CBVAV system operates to meet the zone sensible cooling or sensible heating requirements as dictated by the thermostat schedule(s). The priority control input determines the mode of operation and is specified as Cooling Priority, Heating Priority, or Zone Priority. If Cooling Priority is specified, the system operates to meet the cooling load when any zone served by this system (air loop) requires cooling. If Heating Priority is specified, the system operates to meet the heating load when any zone requires heating. If Zone Priority is specified, the system operates based on the maximum number of zones requiring either heating or cooling.</p>
<p>Once the operating mode is determined, the CBVAV model calculates a target supply air temperature required to operate a single terminal unit at its maximum air flow rate. The remaining terminal units will modulate as required to maintain the dry-bulb temperature in the zone they are serving according to the thermostat schedule for their respective zone. The system air flow rate (through the supply air fan, cooling coil and heat coil) remains constant during cooling operation, heating operation, and no cooling/heating mode as specified by the user. Therefore, as the zone terminal units modulate to reduce zone air flow rates, the excess system air flow is “bypassed” from the bypass duct splitter node back to the bypass duct mixer node of the CBVAV system (see figures above).</p>
<p>The CBVAV system is able to model supply air fan operation in two modes: cycling fan – cycling coil (i.e., AUTO fan) and continuous fan – cycling coil (i.e., fan ON). A Fan:OnOff or Fan:ConstantVolume is used in either case. Since the excess system air flow is bypassed while the zone terminal units modulate, the supply air fan operates the entire simulation time step when heating or cooling is required. For this reason, AUTO fan only allows the supply air fan to turn off when no cooling or heating is required. If fan ON is specified, the supply air fan runs the entire time the system is scheduled to operate (via its availability schedule). The mode of operation for the supply air fan is specified through a fan operating mode schedule where a value of 0 in the schedule indicates cycling fan mode and a value greater than 0 indicates continuous fan mode. If the schedule is not provided, the supply air fan operating mode is considered to be continuous (fan ON).</p>
<p>Output variables reported for the CBVAV system include the supply air fan part-load ratio, the compressor part-load ratio, and the electric consumption of the CBVAV system. Additional output variables report the total heating rate and total cooling rate provided by the CBVAV system. The sensible and latent components for total system cooling and heating are also available as output variables. Reporting of other variables of interest for the CBVAV system (DX coil cooling rate, heating rate, crankcase electric power and energy, supply air fan electric power, etc.) is done by the individual system components (fan, DX cooling coil, and heating coil).</p>
<h4 id="model-description_5">Model Description</h4>
<p>As described previously, the CBVAV system conditions one or more zones and is controlled by zone thermostats (Ref. ZoneControl:Thermostat). For each simulation time step, EnergyPlus performs a zone air heat balance to determine if cooling or heating is required to meet the zone thermostat setpoints, excluding any impacts from CBVAV system operation. CBVAV system performance is then modeled with all heating/cooling coils off but with the supply air fan operating according to the user specified supply air fan operating mode schedule. If the zone air heat balance plus the impact of CBVAV system operation with coils off results in no requirement for heating or cooling by the CBVAV coils, or if the CBVAV system is scheduled off (via its availability schedule), then the CBVAV coils do not operate and the compressor part-load ratio output variable is set to 0. If the model determines that cooling or heating is required and the CBVAV system is scheduled to operate, the model calculates a target supply air temperature required to maintain a single terminal unit at it’s maximum air flow rate, the amount of bypass air returning to the bypass duct mixer node, and the part-load ratio of the cooling or heating coils in order to meet the target supply air temperature.</p>
<p>When high humidity control is desired, a ZoneControl:Humidistat input object and a SetpointManager:SingleZone:Humidity:Maximum, SetpointManager:MultiZone:MaximumHumidity:Average    or SetpointManager:MultiZone:Humidity:Maximum object are required. The air outlet node of the CBVAV system is used as the control node for the setpoint manager. For this reason, only a single humidistat should be specified for one of the zones being served by this system. If humidistat/setpoint manager objects are specified for more than one zone served by this system, only the last of the SetpointManager:SingleZone:Humidity:Maximum objects is used (the setpoint manager objects are read in order of occurrence in the input file). Since the outlet node of the CBVAV system is always used as the control node, the setpoints calculated by the previous setpoint managers are overwritten by the last setpoint manager in the input. When a heat exchanger is used to improve the dehumidification performance of the cooling coil (i.e. CoilSystem:Cooling:DX:HeatExchangerAssisted), the heat exchanger is always active and can not be turned on and off based on zone humidity levels.</p>
<p>The remainder of this section describes the calculations performed when cooling or heating coil operation is required. For any HVAC simulation time step, the CBVAV system can only cool or heat the air, not both. Because the CBVAV system bypasses system air flow back to the inlet of the CBVAV unit, the system operates for the entire simulation time step. If the user specifies continuous fan operation, then the supply air fan continues to operate at a user-specified flow rate even during periods when the coils cycle off. If the user specifies AUTO fan operation, then the supply air fan cycles off for the entire simulation time step only when no cooling or heating is required.</p>
<h5 id="operating-mode">Operating Mode</h5>
<p>The first step in modeling a CBVAV system is to obtain the cooling or heating load for each zone as calculated by EnergyPlus based on the zone thermostat setpoint temperature(s). The calculated loads for each zone are used to determine the total cooling and heating requirements for all zones served by this system. In addition to summing the zone cooling and heating loads, the number of zones in cooling and the number of zones in heating are totalized. The priority control mode specified by the user is then used to determine the operating mode for this simulation time step.</p>
<p>If Cooling Priority is specified and the total cooling requirement in all zones is not equal to zero, then cooling is selected as the operating mode. If the total cooling requirement is equal to zero and the total heating requirement is not equal to zero, then heating is selected as the operating mode. If the total cooling requirement and total heating requirement are equal to zero then the zones are allowed to float (no heating or cooling provided).</p>
<p>If Heating Priority is specified and the total heating requirement in all zones is not equal to zero, then heating is selected as the operating mode. If the total heating requirement is equal to zero and the total cooling requirement is not equal to zero, then cooling is selected as the operating mode. If the total cooling requirement and total heating requirement are equal to zero then the zones are allowed to float (no heating or cooling provided).</p>
<p>If Zone Priority is specified and the total number of zones requiring cooling is greater than the total number of zones requiring heating, then cooling is selected as the operating mode. If the total number of zones requiring heating is greater than the total number of zones requiring cooling, then heating is selected as the operating mode. If the total number of zones requiring cooling is equal to the total number of zones requiring heating, then the magnitude of the total cooling and heating requirements for all zones sets the operating mode. In this case, if the magnitudes of the cooling and heating requirements are zero, then the zones are allowed to float (no heating or cooing provided). If the magnitudes of the cooling and heating requirements are non-zero and identical, then cooling is selected as the operating mode.</p>
<h5 id="calculation-of-bypass-duct-mixer-node-conditions">Calculation of Bypass Duct Mixer Node Conditions</h5>
<p>The operation of this system is unique in that it uses constant-air-volume equipment to provide variable air volume to the conditioned zones. This is accomplished with the use of a bypass duct (shown in the figures above) which shunts excess system air flow from the bypass duct splitter node at the system’s outlet back to the bypass duct mixer node at the system’s inlet. The air conditions at the bypass duct mixer node are based on the inlet air to the CBVAV system, the system outlet air conditions required to meet the zone loads, and the fraction of bypassed air. The following calculations are performed each simulation time step.</p>
<div>\[BypassFrac = 1.0 - \left( {\frac{{{{\dot m}_{supply}}}}{{{{\dot m}_{system}}}}} \right)\]</div>

<div>\[{T_{bypassductmixernode}} = \left( {1 - BypassFrac} \right){T_{inlet}} + \left( {BypassFrac} \right){T_{outlet}}\]</div>

<p>If the model determines that the CBVAV system must supply cooling to the zones, the model first calculates a target outlet air dry-bulb temperature required to operate a single terminal unit at its maximum air flow rate.

<div img="image5076.txt">\(T_{target}^{}\)</div>

<p>= Target supply (outlet) air temperature for the CBVAV system, °C</p>
<p>The model then calculates the part-load ratio of the DX compressor required to meet the target supply (outlet) air temperature. Since the part-load performance of the DX cooling coil is frequently non-linear (Ref: Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed model), the actual part-load ratio for the cooling coil compressor is determined through iterative calculations (successive modeling of the DX cooling coil model) until the CBVAV system’s outlet air temperature (including on/off cycling effects of the DX coil) matches the target supply (outlet) air temperature within a small temperature convergence tolerance (1E-5 ˚C).</p>
<p>Since the supply air fan operates continuously for each simulation time step (or is OFF for the entire HVAC system time step), the air conditions at nodes downstream of the cooling coil are calculated as the average conditions over the simulation time step (i.e., the weighted average of coil’s outlet node conditions when the coil is operating and the coil’s inlet node conditions when the coil is OFF).</p>
<h5 id="heating-operation">Heating Operation</h5>
<p>Modeling the CBVAV system’s DX heating coil is identical to the calculations described above for cooling operation except that the maximum target supply air temperature for all zones is used to control the CBVAV system in heating mode.</p>
<div>\[{T_{target}} = MAX\left( {T_{target}^i} \right);\,\,i = 1,n\]</div>

<p>Iterative calculations (successive modeling of the DX heating coil model) are used to determine the final heating coil part-load ratio to account for the non-linear performance of the DX heating coil at part-load conditions.</p>
<p>When a gas or electric heating coil is used instead of a DX heating coil, the amount of heat required by the coil is calculated based on the target supply (outlet) air temperature and the coil inlet air temperature as follows:</p>
<div>\[{Q_{heating}} = {\dot m_{system}}{C_p}({T_{target}} - {T_{inlet,heatcoil}})\]</div>

<p>= Heating coil inlet air temperature, °C</p>
<h5 id="floating-operation-no-cooling-or-heating">Floating Operation (no cooling or heating)</h5>
<p>When the zone thermostats determine that there is no cooling or heating requirement in any zone, the CBVAV coils are OFF and the zone temperatures are allowed to float. However, a special case exists where the user specifies continuous supply air fan operation and no cooling or heating requirements exist in any zone. In this case, the outlet air temperature of the CBVAV system (with fan ON and coils OFF) is compared to the target outlet air temperatures required to maintain the zone’s cooling and heating setpoint temperatures. If the outlet air temperature with the supply fan ON and coils OFF is below the target outlet air temperature required to maintain the heating setpoint, then heating mode is enabled to avoid overshooting the zone heating setpoint temperature. Conversely, if the outlet air temperature with the supply fan ON and coils OFF is above the target outlet air temperature required to maintain the cooling setpoint, then cooling mode is enabled to avoid overshooting the zone cooling setpoint temperature. This special case is handled at any time a no load condition is reported by the thermostats and overshooting the zone air temperature setpoint is possible regardless of the priority control mode selected by the user.</p>
<h5 id="minimum-and-maximum-outlet-air-temperature-in-coolingheating-operation">Minimum and Maximum Outlet Air Temperature in Cooling/Heating Operation</h5>
<p>The user also specifies a minimum outlet air temperature during cooling operation and a maximum outlet air temperature during heating operation. The target outlet air temperature, as calculated above, is compared to each of these limits during each simulation time step. The resulting target outlet air temperature is used to control the heating and cooling coils.</p>
<div>\[{T_{target}} = MAX\left( {{T_{target}},\,\,{T_{min,cooling}}} \right)\]</div>

<p>= Maximum outlet air temperature during heating operation, °C</p>
<h5 id="air-flow-calculations">Air Flow Calculations</h5>
<p>The changeover-bypass VAV system operates based on user-specified (or autosized) air flow rates. The CBVAV system air flow rate (i.e., air flow through the supply air fan and heating/cooling coils) during cooling operation may be different than the system air flow rate during heating operation. In addition, the system air flow rate when no cooling or heating is required but the supply air fan remains ON can be different than the air flow rates when cooling or heating is required. The outside air flow rates can likewise be different in these various operating modes. The model takes these different air flow rates into account when simulating the performance of the CBVAV system. The system air flow rate for each simulation time step is based on the current operating mode (cooling, heating, or no cooling/heating) and is reported on the inlet/outlet air nodes of the various CBVAV components (e.g. fan, cooling coil, and heating coil). The supply air flow rate delivered to the individual zones is calculated based on the sum of the air flow rates through each terminal unit and is reported at the air inlet and outlet nodes of the CBVAV system each simulation time step. The difference between the system air mass flow rate and the supply air mass flow rate delivered to all zones is equal to the bypass air mass flow rate which is also reported each simulation time step.</p>
<p>The system and outside air flow rates when a system coil is ON (e.g., system air volumetric flow rate during cooling operation, system air volumetric flow rate during heating operation, outside air volumetric air flow rate during cooling operation, and outside air volumetric air flow rate during heating operation) or the system coils are OFF and the fan operates continuously (e.g., system air volumetric flow rate when no cooling or heating is needed and outside air volumetric air flow rate when no cooling or heating is needed) are specified by the user, or can be autosized, and are converted from volumetric flow rate to mass flow rate at standard conditions. If the user has specified cycling fan operation, then the system air and outside air mass flow rates when the system coils are OFF the entire time step are zero. If the user has specified constant fan operation, then the air flow rates when no cooling or heating is needed are used when the system coils are OFF the entire time step.</p>
<p>There is one special case. If the user has specified constant fan operation and they specify that the system air volumetric flow rate when no cooling or heating is needed is zero (or if the field is left blank), then the model assumes that the system air mass flow rate when the system coils are OFF the entire time step is equal to the corresponding air mass flow rate when any system coil was last operating (ON). This model handles the zero (or blank) entry for outside air volumetric flow rate when no cooling or heating is needed in an analogous fashion.</p>

<h4 id="overview_7">Overview</h4>
<p>The input object AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:AirToAir provides a model for an air-to-air heat pump that is a “virtual” component that consists of an on/off or constant volume fan component, a DX cooling coil, a DX heating coil, and a gas or electric supplemental heating coil. The specific configuration of the blow through heat pump is shown in the following figure. For a draw through heat pump, the fan is located between the DX heating coil and the supplemental heating coil.</p>
<p><img alt="FurnaceSchematic_HeatPump" src="../../EngineeringReference/media/image5106.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 227. Schematic of a Blow Through Air-to-Air Heat Pump</p>
<p>While the heat pump may be configured to serve multiple zones, system operation is controlled by a thermostat located in a single “control” zone. One of the key parameters for the heat pump component is the fraction of the total system airflow that goes through the control zone. This fraction is calculated as the ratio of the maximum air mass flow rate for the air loop’s supply inlet node for the control zone (e.g., AirTerminal:SingleDuct:Uncontrolled, field = Maximum Air Flow Rate, converted to mass flow) to the sum of the maximum air mass flow rates for the air loop’s supply inlet nodes for all zones served by this air loop. The heat pump module scales the calculated load for the control zone upward based on this fraction to determine the total load to be met by the heat pump. The module then proceeds to calculate the required part-load ratio for the system coil and the supply air fan to meet this total load. The heating or cooling capacity delivered by the heat pump is distributed to all of the zones served by this system via the direct air units that supply air to each zone. The supply air fraction that goes though the control zone is calculated as follows:</p>
<div>\[Control Zone Air Flow\,Fraction = \frac{{{{\dot m}_{TUMax\,ControlZone}}}}{{\sum\limits_{j = 1}^{NumOfZones} {{{\dot m}_{TUMax\,Zone\,j}}} }}\]</div>

<p>where:</p>
<div img="image5108.txt">\({\dot m_{TUMax\,ControlledZone}}\)</div>

<p>=    maximum air mass flow rate for the air loop’s supply inlet node (terminal unit) for the control zone (kg/s)</p>
<div img="image5109.txt">\({\dot m_{TUMax\,Zone\,j}}\)</div>

<p>=    maximum air mass flow rate for the air loop’s supply inlet node for the jth zone (kg/s)</p>
<div img="image5110.txt">\(NumOfZones\)</div>

<p>=    number of zones, or number of air loop supply air inlet nodes for all zones served by the air loop (-)</p>
<p>The heat pump component is able to model supply air fan operation in two modes: cycling fan – cycling coil (i.e., AUTO fan) and continuous fan – cycling coil (i.e., fan ON). Fan:OnOff must be used to model AUTO fan, while Fan:OnOff or Fan:ConstantVolume can be used to model fan ON. The fan operation mode is specified using a supply air fan operating mode schedule where schedule values of 0 denote cycling fan operation and schedule values other than 0 (a 1 is usually used) denote continuous fan operation. Using this schedule, the furnace fan may be cycled with cooling or heating coil operation or operated continuously based on time of day (e.g. cycling fan operation at night and continuous fan operation during the day). If the fan operating mode schedule name field is left blank in the heat pump object, the heat pump assumes cycling or AUTO fan mode operation throughout the simulation.</p>
<p>The output variables reported by the heat pump object are fan part-load ratio and compressor part-load ratio. Fan part-load ratio is defined as the actual air mass flow rate through the system for the time step divided by the operating supply air mass flow rate specified for the heat pump (<div img="image5111.txt">({{\mathop m\limits^\cdot  actual} \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{\mathop m\limits^\cdot  actual} {\mathop m\limits^\cdot  }}} \right. } {\mathop m\limits^\cdot  }}ON)</div>). The operating supply air mass flow rate may be different for cooling, heating, and when no cooling or heating is required and the fan operates continuously. Compressor part-load ratio is the actual load for the time step divided by the full-load sensible capacity (see Eqn. or Eqn.). Reporting of other variables of interest for the heat pump (heating rate, cooling rate, energy consumption, etc.) is done by the individual system components (fan, DX cooling coil, DX heating coil, and supplemental heating coil).</p>
<h4 id="model-description_6">Model Description</h4>
<p>As described previously, the heat pump is a “virtual” component consisting of a fan, DX cooling coil, DX heating coil and a supplemental heating coil. The sole purpose of the heat pump model is to properly coordinate the operation of the various system components. The following sections describe the flow of information within the model, as well as the differences between cycling and continuous supply air fan operation.</p>
<h4 id="cooling-operation_1">Cooling Operation</h4>
<p>If EnergyPlus determines that the heat pump must supply cooling to the control zone to meet the zone air temperature setpoint, then the heat pump model computes the total sensible cooling load to be delivered to the zones being served based on the control zone sensible cooling load and the fraction of the heat pump air flow that goes through the control zone.</p>
<div>\[Heat\,Pump\,Cooling\,Load\, = \frac{{Control\,Zone\,Cooling\,Load}}{{Control\,Zone\,Air\,Flow\,Fraction}}\]</div>

<p>If the supply air fan operating mode schedule requests cycling fan operation, the model first checks for the presence of an ecomomizer in the outside air system serving the heat pump’s air loop (Ref. AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem). If an outside air system is not present or if an air-side economizer is not used, the heat pump’s compressor is used to meet the heat pump cooling load. If an air-side economizer is used and is active (i.e., economizer controls indicate that conditions are favorable to increase the outside air flow rate), the heat pump will try to meet the cooling load by operating only the supply air fan. If the fan is able to satisfy the heat pump cooling load, the compressor remains off for the entire simulation time step. If the operation of the fan alone is unable to meet the entire cooling load, then the compressor is enabled and additional calculations are performed to determine the compressor’s part-load ratio.</p>
<p>The model then calculates the heat pump’s sensible cooling energy rate delivered to the zones being served when the system runs at full-load conditions and when the DX cooling coil is OFF. If the supply air fan cycles with the compressor, then the sensible cooling energy rate is zero when the cooling coil is OFF. However if the fan is scheduled to run continuously regardless of coil operation, then the sensible cooling energy rate will not be zero when the cooling coil is OFF. Calculating the sensible cooling energy rate involves modeling the supply air fan (and associated fan heat) and the DX cooling coil. The DX heating coil and the supplemental heating coil are also modeled, but only to pass the air properties and mass flow rate from their inlet nodes to their outlet nodes. For each of these cases (full load and DX cooling coil OFF), the sensible cooling energy rate delivered by the heat pump is calculated as follows:</p>
<div>\[Full\;Cool\;Output = (Mass\;Flow\;Rat{e_{ful\;load}}){({h_{out,full\;load}} - {h_{control\;zone}})_{HR\min }} - {\Delta_{sen,\;full\;load}}\]</div>

<div>\[No\;Cool\;Output = (Mass\;Flow\;Rat{e_{coil\;off}}){({h_{out,\;coil\;off}} - {h_{control\;zone}})_{HR\min }} - {\Delta_{sen,\;coil\;off}}\]</div>

<p>where:</p>

<p>With the calculated sensible cooling energy rates and the total sensible cooling load to be met by the system, the part-load ratio for the heat pump is estimated.</p>

<p>Since the part-load performance of the DX cooling coil is frequently non-linear, and the supply air fan heat varies based on cooling coil operation for the case of cycling fan/cycling coil (AUTO fan), the final part-load ratio for the cooling coil compressor and fan are determined through iterative calculations (successive modeling of the cooling coil and fan) until the heat pump’s cooling output matches the cooling load to be met within the convergence tolerance. The convergence tolerance is fixed at 0.001 and is calculated based on the difference between the load to be met and the heat pump’s cooling output divided by the load to be met.</p>

<p>= Heat pump delivered sensible capacity (W)</p>
<p>If the heat pump has been specified with cycling fan/cycling coil (AUTO fan), then the heat pump’s operating supply air mass flow rate is multiplied by PartLoadRatio to determine the average air mass flow rate for the system simulation time step. In this case, the air conditions at nodes downstream of the cooling coil represent the full-load (steady-state) values when the coil is operating.</p>
<p>If the fan operates continuously (i.e., when the supply air fan operating mode schedule values are NOT equal to 0), the operating air mass flow rate through the heat pump is calculated as the average of the user-specified air flow rate when the cooling coil is ON and the user-specified air flow rate when the cooling coil is OFF (user-specified supply air volumetric flow rates converted to dry air mass flow rates).</p>
<div>\[\mathop m\limits^ \bullet  furnace = PartLoadRatio\left( {\mathop m\limits^ \bullet  CoolCoilON} \right) + \left( {1 - PartLoadRatio} \right)\left( {\mathop m\limits^ \bullet  CoilOFF} \right)\]</div>

<p>In this case, the air conditions at nodes downstream of the cooling coil are calculated as the average conditions over the simulation time step (i.e., the weighted average of full-load conditions when the coil is operating and inlet air conditions when the coil is OFF).</p>
<p>Heating Operation</p>
<p>Calculations for heating operation are similar to those for cooling operation in most respects. However, due to the inclusion of a supplemental heating coil, additional calculations are necessary to properly meet the total heating load for the zones being served.</p>
<p>If EnergyPlus determines that the heat pump must supply heating to the control zone to meet the zone air temperature setpoint, then the heat pump model computes the total sensible heating load to be delivered to the zones being served based on the control zone sensible heating load and the control zone airflow fraction.</p>
<div>\[Heat\,Pump\,Heating\,Load\, = \frac{{Control\,Zone\,Heating\,Load}}{{Control\,Zone\,Air\,Flow\,Fraction}}\]</div>

<p>The model then calculates the heat pump’s sensible heating energy rate delivered to the zones being served when the system runs at full-load conditions and when the DX heating coil is OFF (without supplemental heater operation in either case). If the supply air fan cycles with the compressor, then the sensible heating energy rate is zero when the compressor is OFF. However if the fan is scheduled to run continuously regardless of coil operation, then the sensible heating energy rate will not be zero when the compressor is OFF. Calculating the sensible heating energy rate involves modeling the supply air fan (and associated fan heat), the DX cooling coil (simply to pass the air properties and mass flow rate from its inlet node to its outlet node), the DX heating coil, and the supplemental heating coil (simply to pass the air properties and mass flow rate from its inlet node to its outlet node).

<p>If the heat pump’s DX heating coil output at full load is insufficient to meet the entire heating load, PartLoadRatio is set equal to 1.0 (compressor and fan are not cycling) and the remaining heating load is passed to the supplemental heating coil. If the heat pump model determines that the outdoor air temperature is below the minimum outdoor air temperature for compressor operation, the compressor is turned off and the entire heating load is passed to the supplemental gas or electric heating coil.

<h4 id="high-humidity-control-with-airtoair-heatpump-model">High Humidity Control with AirToAir HeatPump Model</h4>
<p>The specific configuration of the AirToAir HeatPump with supplemental heating coil is shown above (see Figure 227). This figure shows the fan placement when a blow through fan is specified. If a draw through fan is specified, the fan is located between the heating coil and the supplemental heating coil. The system is controlled to keep the high relative humidity in the control zone from exceeding the setpoint specified in the object ZoneControl:Humidistat. This option is available when the supply air fan operates continuously (i.e., the supply air fan operating mode schedule values are never equal to 0) or the supply air fan cycles with the compressor. In addition, when high humidity control is specified and the compressor operates, the heatpump operates at the cooling air flow rate when a zone heating load is present as determined by the zone thermostat. High humidity control is specified as either None, MultiMode, or CoolReheat in the Dehumidification Control Type input field. MultiMode is specified when a heat exchanger is used to improve the dehumidification performance of the cooling coil. The heat exchanger will be activated when the sensible part-load ratio is insufficient to meet the zone latent load. CoolReheat is specified when a DX cooling coil is used to over-cool the supply air stream in order to meet the zone latent load. In this case, a supplemental heating coil will ensure the zone temperature does not fall below the zone heating temperature set point. When a heat exchanger is used in conjunction with a DX cooling coil and CoolReheat is specified as the Dehumidification Control Type, the heat exchanger is “locked on” to meet either the sensible or latent cooling load. If the dehumidification control type is selected as None and a heat exchanger assisted cooling coil is used, the heat exchanger is “locked on” and the air conditioner runs only to meet the sensible cooling load. A supplemental heating coil is required for all dehumidification control types.</p>
<p>The model first calculates the <em>PartLoadRatio</em> required meeting the sensible cooling load.  The heatpump’s sensible cooling load is determined from the control zone sensible cooling load to the cooling setpoint and the control zone air flow fraction to maintain the dry-bulb temperature setpoint in the control zone.:</p>
<div>\[HeatPumpCoolingLoad = \,\frac{{ControlZoneCoolingLoad}}{{ControlZoneAirFlowFraction}}\]</div>

<p>The heatpump’s sensible cooling load to be met and the full load cooling output are used to calculate the sensible the part-load ratio iteratively based on user specified convergence criterion.</p>
<div>\[PartLoadRatio = MAX\left( {0.0,\,\frac{{ABS\left( {HeatPumpCoolingLoad - NoCoolOutput} \right)}}{{ABS\left( {FullCoolOutput - NoCoolOutput} \right)}}} \right)\]</div>

<p>When the heat pump’s sensible cooling capacity meets the system sensible cooling load at a given sensible part load ratio, then the Heat pump meets the controlled zone cooling setpoint temperature. If a moisture (latent) load exists because the control zone humidity has exceeded the setpoint, the total moisture load to be met by the heat pumps (HeatPumpMoistureLoad) is calculated based on the control zone moisture load and the control zone air flow fraction.</p>
<div>\[HeatPumpMoistureLoad = \,\frac{{ControlZoneMoitureLoad}}{{ControlZoneAirFlowFraction}}\]</div>

<p>Then the <em>LatentPartLoadRatio</em> required to meet the high humidity setpoint is calculated as follows:</p>
<div>\[LatentPartLoadRatio = MIN\left( {PL{R_{Min}},\,\frac{{ABS\left( {HeatPumpMoistureLoad - NoLatentOutput} \right)}}{{ABS\left( {FullLatentOutput - NoLatentOutput} \right)}}} \right)\]</div>

<p>The model uses the greater of the two part-load ratios, <em>PartLoadRatio</em> or <em>LatentPartLoadRatio</em>, to determine the operating part-load ratio of the Heat Pump’s DX cooling coil.</p>
<div>\[LatentPartLoadRatio = MAX\left( {PartLoadRatio,\,LatentPartLoadRatio} \right)\]</div>

<p><em>       =  </em>the minimum part-load ratio, which is usually 0.0. For the case when the latent capacity degradation model is used (Ref: DX Cooling Coil Model), this value is the minimum part-load ratio at which the cooling coil will dehumidify the air.</p>
<p>When the predicted zone air temperature is above the heating setpoint and if there is a dehumidification load, the supplemental heating coil load is required to offset the excess cooling as shown in Figure 228. If the model determines that the LatentPartLoadRatio is to be used as the operating part-load ratio of the heatpump’s cooling coil, the supplemental heating coil is used to offset the excess sensible capacity provided by the heat pump DX cooling coil. The model first checks the sensible load that exists for the current simulation time step (predicted zone temperature with no HVAC operation compared to the thermostat setpoint temperatures). If a sensible cooling load or no sensible cooling or heating load exists (see Figure 2),  the model calculates the difference between the sensible heating load required to reach or maintain the heating dry-bulb temperature setpoint and the actual sensible cooling energy rate delivered by the unit (with LatentPartLoadRatio). In this case, thesupplemental heating coil is used to offset the excess sensible cooling energy provided by the DX cooling coil (if any) that could have caused an overshoot of the heating dry-bulb temperature setpoint. Note that when a humidistat is used and high humidity control is required, the zone dry-bulb temperature will typically move toward the heating temperature setpoint when a high moisture (latent) load exists.</p>

<p>Figure 228. Supplemental heating coil load when predicted zone air temperature is above the heating Setpoint</p>
<p>If a heating load exists (Figure 229), the supplementalheating coil is used to meet the heating coil load and at the same time offset the entire sensible cooling energy rate of the DX cooling coil (to meet the humidistat setpoint). Note that when a heating load exists and high humidity control is required, the heat pump operates at the user-specified cooling air flow rate for the entire simulation time step. As with the fan, and DX cooling coil, report variables associated with supplemental heating coil performance (e.g., heating coil energy, heating coil rate, heating coil gas or electric energy, heating coil runtime fraction, etc.) are managed in the supplemental (heating) coil object.</p>

<h4 id="overview_8">Overview</h4>
<p>The input object AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:AirToAir:MultiSpeed provides a model for a multispeed air-to-air heat pump that is a “virtual” component that consists of an on/off or constant volume fan component, a multispeed DX cooling coil, a multispeed DX heating coil, and a gas or electric supplemental heating coil. The main difference between this heat pump object and other EnergyPlus heat pump objects is that this object allows from two to four discrete compressor speeds for heating and cooling operation (instead of a single speed for each mode). The specific configuration of the blow through heat pump is shown in the following figure. For a draw through heat pump, the fan is located between the DX heating coil and the supplemental heating coil.</p>

<p>Figure 230. Schematic of a Multispeed Air-to-Air Heat Pump (Blow-through Configuration)</p>
<p>While the heat pump may be configured to serve multiple zones, system operation is controlled by a thermostat located in a single “control” zone. One of the key parameters for the heat pump component is the fraction of the total system airflow that goes through the control zone. This fraction is calculated as the ratio of the maximum air mass flow rate for the air loop’s supply inlet node for the control zone (e.g., AirTerminal:SingleDuct:Uncontrolled, field = Maximum Air Flow Rate, converted to mass flow) to the sum of the maximum air mass flow rates for the air loop’s supply inlet nodes for all zones served by this air loop. The heat pump module scales the calculated load for the control zone upward based on this fraction to determine the total load to be met by the heat pump. The module then proceeds to calculate the required cycling ratio, speed ratio and speed number for the system coil and determines the supply air mass flow rate to meet this total load based on the speed number. The cycling ratio is the ratio of the sensible load (heating or cooling) to the steady-state capacity of the multispeed heat pump’s DX heating or cooling coil at Speed 1 for the entire system time step. It is equivalent to the part load ratio for a single speed DX coil. The value is between 0.0 and 1.0 when the system operates at its lowest speed (Speed 1) and 1.0 when the multispeed heat pump operates at speeds above 1. The speed ratio is the ratio of time in a system time step that the compressor is at rated speed between two consecutive speed numbers ([Compressor Speed - Compressor speed at Speed i-1] / [Compressor speed at Speed i - Compressor speed at Speed i-1]). The compressor speed ratio is between 0.0 and 1.0 when the speed number is above 1 and is 0.0 during Speed 1 operation. The speed number is the lowest index number whose corresponding full-load sensible capacity at the given air mass flow rate is greater than or equal to the sensible load (heating or cooling) in a system time step. The heating or cooling capacity delivered by the heat pump is distributed to all of the zones served by this system via the direct air units that supply air to each zone.</p>
<p>The heat pump component is able to model supply air fan operation in two modes: cycling fan – cycling coil (i.e., AUTO fan) and continuous fan – cycling coil (i.e., fan ON). Fan:OnOff must be used to model AUTO fan, while Fan:OnOff or Fan:ConstantVolume can be used to model fan ON. The fan operation mode is specified using a supply air fan operating mode schedule where schedule values of 0 denote cycling fan operation and schedule values other than 0 (a 1 is usually used) denote continuous fan operation. Using this schedule, the supply air fan may be cycled with cooling or heating coil operation or operated continuously based on time of day (e.g. cycling fan operation at night and continuous fan operation during the day).</p>
<p>Several output variables are reported by the heat pump object including fan part-load ratio, compressor part-load ratio, cycling ratio, speed ratio and speed number. Fan part-load ratio is defined as the actual air mass flow rate through the system for the time step divided by the operating supply air mass flow rate specified for the heat pump (<div img="image5148.txt">({{{{\dot m}<em>{actual}}} \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{{{\dot m}</em>{actual}}} {{{\dot m}<em>{design}}}}} \right. } {{{\dot m}</em>{ON}}}})</div>) at speed 1. Fan part-load ratio is set to 1.0 when the heat pump operates at speeds above 1. The operating supply air mass flow rate may be different for cooling, heating, and when no cooling or heating is required. Compressor part-load ratio is the actual load for the time step divided by the full-load sensible capacity (see Eqn. or Eqn.). If the defrost strategy is reverse cycle for a DX heating coil, the compressor part-load ratio is the sum of the actual load and the defrost load divided by the full-load sensible capacity. Therefore, the compressor part load ratio for the DX heating coil may be greater than the cycling ratio. This heat pump object also reports the sensible, latent and total cooling and heating rate, as well as the electricity consumption for the unit with separate accounting of auxiliary electric consumption. Furthermore, five report variables related to waste heat recovery are available if the user chooses to model this option.</p>
<h4 id="model-description_7">Model Description</h4>
<p>As described previously, the heat pump is a “virtual” component consisting of a fan, multispeed DX cooling coil, multispeed DX heating coil and supplemental heating coil. The sole purpose of the heat pump model is to properly coordinate the operation of the various system components. The following sections describe the flow of information within the model, as well as the differences between cycling and continuous supply air fan operation.</p>
<h4 id="cooling-operation_2">Cooling Operation</h4>
<p>The description of heat pump cooling operation is divided in two sections: sensible capacity and average supply air flow rate. Actually, the determinations of capacity and supply air flow rate are related, so these calculations are performed in unison.</p>
<h5 id="capacity-calculation">Capacity calculation</h5>
<p>If EnergyPlus determines that the heat pump must supply cooling to the control zone to meet the zone air temperature setpoint, then the heat pump model computes the total sensible cooling load (negative) to be delivered to the zones being served based on the control zone sensible cooling load and the fraction of the heat pump air flow that goes through the control zone.</p>
<div>\[Heat\;Pump\;Cooling\;Load = \frac{{Control\;Zone\;Cooling\;Load}}{{Control\;Zone\;Air\;Flow\;Fraction}}\]</div>

<p>The model then calculates the heat pump’s sensible cooling energy rate delivered to the zones being served when the system runs at full-load conditions at the highest speed and when the DX cooling coil is OFF. If the supply air fan cycles with the compressor, then the sensible cooling energy rate is zero when the cooling coil is OFF. However if the fan is scheduled to run continuously regardless of coil operation, then the sensible cooling energy rate will not be zero when the cooling coil is OFF. Calculating the sensible cooling energy rate involves modeling the supply air fan (and associated fan heat) and the multispeed DX cooling coil. The multispeed DX heating coil and the supplemental heating coil are also modeled, but only to pass the air properties and mass flow rate from their inlet nodes to their outlet nodes. For each of these cases (full load at highest cooling speed and DX cooling coil OFF), the sensible cooling energy rate delivered by the heat pump is calculated as follows:</p>
<div img="image5150.txt">\(FullCoolOutpu{t_{Highest\;Speed}} = \left( {{{\dot m}_{HighestSpeed}}} \right){\left( {{h_{out,full\;load}} - {h_{control\;zone}}} \right)_{HR\min }} - {\Delta_{sen,HighestSpeed}}\)</div>

<div img="image5151.txt">\(NoCoolOutput = \left( {{{\dot m}_{CoilOff}}} \right){\left( {{h_{out,coil\;off}} - {h_{control\;zone}}} \right)_{HR\min }} - {\Delta_{sen,coil\;off}}\)</div>

<p>where:</p>

<p>If the heat pump’s sensible cooling rate at the highest speed (full load, no cycling) is insufficient to meet the entire cooling load, the controlled zone conditions will not be met. The reported cycling rate and speed ratio are 1, and the speed number is set to the highest index number. If the total sensible cooling load to be met by the system is less than the sensible cooling rate at the highest speed, then the following steps are performed.</p>
<p>·        Calculate the sensible cooling energy rate at Speed 1</p>
<div>\[FullCoolOutpu{t_{Speed1}} = \left( {{{\dot m}_{Speed1}}} \right){\left( {{h_{out,fullload}} - {h_{control\;zone}}} \right)_{HR\min }} - {\Delta_{sen,Speed1}}\]</div>

<p>·        If the sensible cooling energy rate delivered by the heat pump at Speed 1 is greater or equal to the sensible load, the cycling ratio (part-load ratio) for the heat pump is estimated.</p>
<div>\[\begin{array}{l}CyclingRatio = \frac{{ABS(HeatingCoilSensibleLoad)}}{{FullHeatingCoilCapacity}}\\\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\; = MAX\left( {0.0,\frac{{ABS(Heat\;Pump\;Heating\;Load - AddedFanHeat)}}{{ABS(FullHeatOutpu{t_{Speed1}} - AddedFanHea{t_{Speed1}})}}} \right)\end{array}\]</div>

<p>Since the part-load performance of the DX cooling coil is frequently non-linear,and the supply air fan heat varies based on cooling coil operation for the case of cycling fan/cycling coil (AUTO fan), the final part-load ratio for the cooling coil compressor and fan are determined through iterative calculations (successive modeling of the cooling coil and fan) until the heat pump’s cooling output matches the cooling load to be met within the convergence tolerance.

<p>= Air mass flow rate in the supply inlet node in the controlled zone [kg/s]</p>
<p>For this case where speed 1 operation was able to meet the required cooling load, the speed ratio is set to zero and speed number is equal to 1.</p>
<p>·        If the heat pump’s cooling output at full load for Speed 1 is insufficient to meet the entire cooling load, the Cycling ratio is set equal to 1.0 (compressor and fan are not cycling). Then the cooling speed is increased and the delivered sensible capacity is calculated. If the full load sensible capacity at Speed n is greater than or equal to the sensible load, the speed ratio for the heat pump is estimated:</p>
<div img="image5165.txt">\(Speed{\kern 1pt} Ratio = \frac{{ABS(Heat{\kern 1pt} Pump{\kern 1pt} Cooling{\kern 1pt} Load - AddeFanHeat - Full{\kern 1pt} Cool{\kern 1pt} Outpu{t_{Speed{\kern 1pt} n - 1}})}}{{ABS(Full{\kern 1pt} CoolOutpu{t_{Speed{\kern 1pt} n}} - Full{\kern 1pt} CoolOutpu{t_{Speed{\kern 1pt} n - 1}})}}\)</div>

<p>Although a linear relationship is assumed by applying the speed ratio to obtain the effective capacity and mass flow rate between speed n and n-1, the outlet air node conditions are dependent on the combined outputs and may not be linear. In addition, the supply air fan heat varies with the speed ratio due to different supply mass flow rates between speed n and n-1 . Therefore, the final speed ratio for the cooling coil compressor and fan are determined through iterative calculations (successive modeling of the cooling coil and fan) until the heat pump’s cooling output matches the cooling load to be met within the convergence tolerance.

<p>Speed 1 operation</p>
<p>If the heat pump has been specified with cycling fan/cycling coil (AUTO fan), then the heat pump’s operating supply air mass flow rate is determined by the cycling ratio (PartLoadRatio) for Speed 1. The supply air mass flow rate is multiplied by the cycling ratio to determine the average air mass flow rate for the system simulation time step.

<p>If the fan operates continuously (i.e., when the supply air fan operating mode schedule values are NOT equal to 0), the operating air mass flow rate through the heat pump is calculated as the average of the user-specified air flow rate when the heat pump cooling coil is ON at Speed 1 and the user-specified air flow rate when the heat pump cooling coil is OFF (user-specified supply air volumetric flow rates converted to dry air mass flow rates).</p>

<p>= Air mass flow rate in the supply inlet node in the controlled zone [kg/s]</p>
<p>For this case where speed 1 operation was able to meet the required heating load, the speed ratio is set to zero and speed number is equal to 1.</p>
<p>3.    If the heat pump’s heating output at full load for Speed 1 is insufficient to meet the entire heatling load, the Cycling ratio (PartLoadRatio) is set equal to 1.0 (compressor and fan are not cycling). Then the heating speed is increased and the delivered sensible capacity is calculated. If the full load sensible capacity at Speed n is greater than or equal to the sensible load, the speed ratio for the heat pump is estimated:</p>
<div>\[Speed{\kern 1pt} Ratio = \frac{{ABS(Heat{\kern 1pt} Pump{\kern 1pt} Heating{\kern 1pt} Load - AddeFanHeat - Full{\kern 1pt} Heat{\kern 1pt} Outpu{t_{Speed{\kern 1pt} \;n - 1}})}}{{ABS(Full{\kern 1pt} HeatOutpu{t_{Speed\;n}} - Full{\kern 1pt} HeatOutpu{t_{Speed\;n - 1}})}}\]</div>

<p>Although a linear relationship is assumed by applying the speed ratio to obtain the effective capacity and air mass flow rate between speed n and n-1, the outlet node conditions are dependent on the combined outputs and may not be linear. In addition, the supply air fan heat varies based on heating coil operation for the case of cycling fan/cycling coil (AUTO fan). Therefore, the final speed ratio for the heating coil compressor and fan are determined through iterative calculations (successive modeling of the heating coil and fan) until the heat pump’s heating output matches the heating load to be met within the convergence tolerance. The convergence tolerance is fixed at 0.001 and is calculated based on the difference between the load to be met and the heat pump’s heating output divided by the load to be met.</p>
<div>\[Tolerance = 0.001 \ge \frac{{Heat\,Pump\,Heating\,Load - HeatPumpOutpu{t_{SpeedRatio}}}}{{Heat\,Pump\,Heating\,Load}}\]</div>

<p>The air mass flow rate calculations during heating operation are the same as those described above for cooling operation.</p>
<h4 id="fan-placement">Fan Placement</h4>
<p>Supply air fan placement impacts the iteration strategy. When the fan placement type is blow through, the air mass flow rate and coil part load factor (PLF) affect the fan outlet conditions. Since the fan is upstream of the coil components with this fan placement, the fan outlet conditions are calculated without knowing the next component’s performance at the beginning of each iteration. DX coil performance is strongly dependent on the inlet conditions, so without correct inlet conditions the DX coil components may not be simulated correctly. Therefore, the heat pump components are called twice for each iteration when fan placement is ‘blow through’. The correct part load factor for the fan component is obtained after the first call, so that the more realistic fan outlet conditions are used to simulate the coil performance in the second call. This extra call to the heat pump components is not required for the draw through fan since the supply air fan is located downstream of the DX coils with this fan placement.</p>
<h4 id="waste-heat-calculation_1">Waste Heat Calculation</h4>
<p>When the heat recovery is active (the value of the Design Heat Recovery Water Flow Rate field is greater than 0), the outlet node temperature of heat recovery is calculated based on the recoverable waste heat generated by its child objects (Coil:Cooling:DX:MultiSpeed and Coil:Heating:DX:MultiSpeed):</p>
<div>\[{T_{outlet}} = {T_{inlet}} + \frac{{{Q_{WasteHeat}}}}{{{C_p}{{\dot m}_{hr}}}}\]</div>

<h3 id="dx-cooling-package">DX Cooling Package</h3>
<h4 id="overview_9">Overview</h4>
<p>The DX cooling package subsystem model provides a “virtual” component that consists of a DX air cooling coil component as shown in the figure below. The CoilSystem:Cooling:DX input object provides a container component that controls the associated DX cooling coil which is specified in a separate object. This coil can be specified anywhere in the air loop simulation and is controlled by the setpoint(s) on the control node. Optional dehumidification controls may also be specified. CoilSystem:Cooling:DX assumes continuous fan operation for any given time step, because it is not able to control cycling fan operation in the way that other AirLoopHVAC:Unitary* systems can.</p>
<p>This system does not need any plant specification and will provide the electric consumption necessary to operate the compressor and the condenser fan.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../EngineeringReference/media/image5198.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 231.  Schematic of Packaged DX Cooling Subsystem in Air Loop for a Blow-Thru Application</p>
<h4 id="controls_1">Controls</h4>
<p>The system calculates the current sensible load using the temperature of the inlet node and the System Node Setpoint Temp on the control node. If the control node is not the outlet node, the desired outlet node temperature is adjusted for the current temperature difference between the outlet node and the control node. Likewise, the current latent load is calculated using the humidity ratio of the inlet node and the System Node Humidity Ratio Max on the control node. The controls determine the required coil run-time fraction and dehumidification mode (if applicable) using the steps outlined below.</p>
<h5 id="step-1-meet-sensible-load-requirement_1">Step 1 – Meet Sensible Load Requirement</h5>
<p>The controls first attempt to meet the sensible requirement. The specified DX coil model is called with a part-load ratio (PLR) of 1.0 to determine the full-load output of the coil. This is compared with the desired outlet node temperature and a sensible PLR is calculated. If the PLR is &lt;1.0, a Regula-Falsi iteration routine is called to determine the coil run-time fraction which results in the desired outlet node temperature. For a variable-speed DX cooling coil, if the load is smaller than the sensible capacity at the lowest speed, the coil run-time fraction is determined in the same way as a single-speed DX cooling coil. Otherwise, its speed level and speed ratio between two neighboring speeds are selected to match the load.</p>
<p>If the cooling coil type is specified as CoilSystem:Cooling:DX:CoolingHeatExchanganerAssisted and the dehumidification control type is specified as CoolReheat, the heat exchanger is active during this attempt to meet the sensible requirement.</p>
<h5 id="step-2-meet-latent-load-requirement-if-activated_1">Step 2 – Meet Latent Load Requirement (if activated)</h5>
<p>If dehumidification controls are active, the leaving humidity ratio resulting from operation to meet the sensible load (Step 1 above) is compared with the desired outlet node humidity ratio. If the humidity requirement is already met, then no further control action is taken. If the humidity requirement has not been met, then the coil is re-simulated depending on the type of humidity control.</p>
<h5 id="step-2a-humidity-control-multimode_1">Step 2a – Humidity Control = MultiMode</h5>
<p>If the humidity control type is MultiMode, then the coil's enhanced dehumidification mode is activated when the coil type is Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoStageWithHumidityControlMode or the heat exchanger is activated when the coil type is CoilSystem:Cooling:DX:CoolingHeatExchangerAssisted and Step 1 above is repeated to meet the sensible load using the coil performance resulting from the enhanced dehumidificaiton mode. This is a semi-passive approach to dehumidification which may fall short or may exceed the dehumidification requirement. If the user has specified Run on Latent Load = Yes in the CoilSystem:Cooling:DX object, and there is no sensible load to be met, then the system will try to meet the entire dehumidification load. If dehumidification mode should not be active when there is no sensible load, then choose Run on Latent Load = No.</p>
<h5 id="step-2b-humidity-control-coolreheat_1">Step 2b – Humidity Control = CoolReheat</h5>
<p>If the humidity control type is CoolReheat, the coil is re-simulated to achieve the desired outlet node humidity ratio. This option is valid for all cooling coil types. When the coil type is Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoStageWithHumidityControlMode, only the cooling performance mode is used for this step and enhanced dehumidification mode is not activated.</p>
<h3 id="dx-heating-package">DX Heating Package</h3>
<h4 id="overview_10">Overview</h4>
<p>The DX heating package subsystem model provides a “virtual” component that consists of a DX air-to-air heating coil component and associated controls. The CoilSystem:Heating:DX input object provides a container component that controls the associated DX heating coil  which is specified in a separate object. See the entry called Single-Speed and Variable-Speed Electric Heat Pump DX Air Heating Coil for details of the coil model itself.  This coil can be specified anywhere in the air loop simulation and is controlled by the setpoint on the heating coil’s outlet node. This model is analogous to the model for CoilSystem:Cooling:DX which is similar but for cooling.  The model assumes continuous fan operation for any given time step, because it is not able to control cycling fan operation in the way that other AirLoopHVAC:Unitary* systems can.</p>
<p>This system does not need any plant specification and will provide the electric consumption necessary to operate the compressor and the condenser fan.</p>
<h4 id="controls_2">Controls</h4>
<p>The DX heating package system calculates how the coil should operate to meet current sensible load using the temperature of the inlet node and the System Node Setpoint Temp on the outlet node. The controls determine the required coil run-time fraction to meet the sensible requirement. The Single-Speed Electric Heat Pump DX Air Heating Coil model is called with a part-load ratio (PLR) of 1.0 to determine the full-load output of the coil. If the PLR is &lt;1.0, a Regula-Falsi iteration routine is called to determine the coil run-time fraction which results in the desired outlet node temperature. For a variable-speed DX heating coil, if the load is smaller than the heating capacity at the lowest speed, the coil run-time fraction is determined in the same way as a single-speed DX heating coil. Otherwise, its speed level and speed ratio between two neighboring speeds are selected to match the load.</p>
<h3 id="desiccant-dehumidifier-package">Desiccant Dehumidifier Package</h3>
<h4 id="overview_11">Overview</h4>
<p>The input object Dehumidifier:Desiccant:System provides a model that packages components for a desiccant-based subsystem that dehumidifies an air stream, normally called the process air stream. A second heated air stream, called the regeneration air stream, is used to remove the collected moisture from the desiccant heat exchanger and this moisture-laden air is then usually exhausted from the building. This Dehumidifier:Desiccant:System object is similar to the Dehumidifier:Desiccant:NoFans object but has some additional modeling capabilities.</p>
<p>The Dehumidifier:Desiccant:System desiccant dehumidifier object in EnergyPlus is a compound object that can be placed anywhere in an air loop. Common locations for this object are in an AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem or in the main air loop downstream of a cooling coil (postcooling desiccant dehumidifier). This compound object coordinates the operation of several ‘children’ objects: a desiccant heat exchanger, a regeneration air fan, and an optional regeneration air heater. If this dehumidifier is placed in the main air loop immediately downstream of a direct expansion (DX) cooling coil, then the dehumidifier’s operation can be coordinated with the operation of the companion DX coil and it is also possible to specify that the DX system’s condenser waste heat can be used to help regenerate the desiccant heat exchanger. For the case of condenser waste heat regeneration, an optional exhaust fan can also be modeled by this desiccant dehumidifier compound object to help maintain a setpoint temperature for air entering the regeneration side of the desiccant heat exchanger. Refer to the EnergyPlus Input Output Reference for the specific input syntax for this desiccant dehumidifier object.</p>

<h4 id="control-logic">Control Logic</h4>
<p>The model first decides if the dehumidifier can operate for the simulation time step, based on its availability schedule and if there is air flow detected on the process air inlet node. If available to operate, then the target humidity ratio for the process outlet air is determined based on the maximum humidity ratio setpoint on the control node (System Node Setpoint Humidity Ratio Max). If the control node is not the process air outlet node, the target humidity ratio is adjusted for the current humidity ratio difference between the process air outlet node and the control node. If the humidity ratio of the process inlet air is greater than the target humidity ratio for the process outlet air, then the dehumidifier operates to meet the target to the extent possible.</p>
<p>Once it is determined that the dehumidifier should operate, the components upstream of the desiccant heat exchanger’s regeneration inlet are modeled. The actual components that are modeled depend on the configuration specified by the user.</p>
<p>If the waste heat from the companion cooling coil is being used to heat the regeneration air, then this model determines the temperature of the air leaving the cooling coil condenser. The user may also specify a setpoint temperature for the regeneration air entering the desiccant heat exchanger and an optional exhaust fan, which can impact the condenser leaving air temperature. For this case, the exhaust fan is used to control the condenser leaving air temperature by boosting the air flow rate through the condenser to meet the setpoint temperature (minus regeneration fan heat if blow through fan placement).</p>
<p>Note: If the desiccant dehumidifier is OFF for a simulation time step but its companion cooling coil is operating and is specified to provide regeneration air heating, then the exhaust fan operates at the maximum air flow rate (i.e., this fan serves at the condenser fan for the companion cooling coil system when regeneration air heating is specified, so the inputs for the companion cooling coil object should not include the condenser fan energy since the condenser fan energy is modeled by the Dehumidifier:Desiccant:SystemDesiccant Dehumidifier object).</p>
<p>The exhaust fan power is determined as follows:</p>
<div>\[\begin{array}{l}If\,dehumidifier\,is\,operating:\\\,\,\,PL{R_{exhaust}} = \,\frac{{{{\mathop m\limits^ \bullet  }_{exhaust}}}}{{\left( {{\rho_{Std}} * {{\mathop {\rm{V}}\limits^ \bullet  }_{exhaust,\,max}}} \right)}}\\\,\,\,{P_{exhaust}} = \,{P_{exhaust,\,max}} * \,ExhFanModFac\\\\If\,dehumidifier\,\,is\,\,not\,\,operating\,\,but\,\,companion\,\,coil\,\,is\,\,operating:\\\,\,\,{P_{exhaust}} = \,{P_{exhaust,\,max}} * \,PL{R_{companion\,coil}}\end{array}\]</div>

<p>Once the outlet conditions from the companion coil condenser are determined (if present), then the regeneration air fan (if blow through configuration) and regeneration air heater (if present) are simulated. To the extent possible (e.g., if the heater is available to operate based on its availability schedule and it has sufficient heating capacity), the regeneration air heater operates to raise its outlet air temperature to the specified regeneration inlet air setpoint temperature.</p>
<p>With the inlet air conditions to the regeneration and process sides of the desiccant heat exchanger now known, the performance of the desiccant heat exchanger is modeled. If the desiccant dehumidifier is specified with a companion cooling coil upstream of the heat exchanger’s process inlet, then the model assumes that the dehumidifier operates at the same time as the companion coil (same part-load ratio). If not, then the desiccant dehumidifier model calculates the fraction of time it must operate to meet the process outlet air maximum humidity target (setpoint) using the following equation:</p>

<h4 id="overview_12">Overview</h4>
<p>The input object AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:WaterToAir provides a model for a water-to-Air heat pump that is a “virtual” component that consists of an on/off fan component, a water-to-air heat pump cooling coil, a water-to-air heat pump heating coil, and a gas or electric supplemental heating coil. The specific configuration of the blowthru heat pump is shown in the following figure. For a drawthru heat pump, the fan is located between the water-to-air heat pump heating coil and the supplemental heating coil. The configuration of the water-to-air heat pump in the air loop is similar to an air-to-air heat pump. In addition, a water-to-air heat pump has a water loop connection on its source side. The water loop can be served by a condenser loop (like GHE for Ground source systems), or by a cooling tower/ boiler plant loop (for water loop systems).</p>

<p>There are two different models for water-to-air heat pump cooling and heating coils. Cooling and heating coils are modeled using a Single Speed or Variable Speed Equation Fit model or a Parameter Estimation model. The parameter estimation procedure is quite detailed and the equation fit model is designed to simplify the user inputs. Each model is discussed in short in the following sections. The Variable-Speed Equation Fit model is described in a separate section, as Coil:Cooling:WaterToAirHeatPump:VariableSpeedEquationFit and Coil:Heating:WaterToAirHeatPump:VariableSpeedEquationFit.</p>
<h4 id="single-speed-equation-fit-model">Single Speed Equation-Fit Model:</h4>
<p>This section describes the equation-fit model for Water-to-Air heat pump  (Object names: <strong>Coil:Cooling:WaterToAirHeatPump:EquationFit</strong> and <strong>Coil:Heating:WaterToAirHeatPump:EquationFit</strong>). This documentation is derived from the M.S. dissertation of Tang (2005) which is available on the Oklahoma State University web site . The model uses five non-dimensional equations or curves to predict the heat pump performance in cooling and heating mode. The methodology involved using the generalized least square method to generate a set of performance coefficients from the catalog data at indicated reference conditions. Then the respective coefficients and indicated reference conditions are used in the model to simulate the heat pump performance. The variables or inlet conditions that influenced the water-to-air heat pump performance are load side inlet water temperature, source side inlet temperature, source side water flow rate and load side water flow rate. The governing equations for the cooling and heating mode are as following:</p>

<p>The inlet conditions or variables are divided by the reference conditions. This formulation allows the coefficients to fall into smaller range of values. Moreover, the value of the coefficient indirectly represents the sensitivity of the output to that particular inlet variable.

<h4 id="coefficient-estimation-procedure">Coefficient estimation procedure:</h4>
<p>The generalized least square method is used to generate the coefficients. This method utilizes an optimization method which calculates the coefficients that will give the least amount of differences between the model outputs and the catalog data. A set of coefficients for the cooling mode is generated which includes A1-A5 for total cooling capacity, B1-B6 for sensible cooling capacity, and C1-C5 for power consumption. The same procedure is repeated for the heating mode to generate the coefficients E1-E5 and F1-F5. An information flow chart showing the inputs, reference conditions, performance coefficients and outputs are shown in the figure below:</p>

<h4 id="high-humidity-control-with-watertoair-heatpump-equation-fit-model">High Humidity Control with WaterToAir HeatPump Equation Fit model</h4>
<p>The specific configuration of the WaterToAir HeatPump with supplemental heating coil is shown above (see Figure 234). This figure shows the fan placement when a blow through fan is specified. If a draw through fan is specified, the fan is located between the heating coil and the reheat coil. The system is controlled to keep the high relative humidity in the control zone from exceeding the setpoint specified in the object ZoneControl:Humidistat. When high humidity control is specified and the compressor operates, the heatpump always operates at the cooling air flow rate when a zone heating load is present as determined by the zone thermostat. High humidity control is specified as either None, or CoolReheat in the Dehumidification Control Type input field. CoolReheat is specified when a DX cooling coil is used to over-cool the supply air stream in order to meet the zone latent load. In this case, a supplemental heating coil will ensure the zone temperature does not fall below the zone heating temperature set point. If the dehumidification control type is selected as None, the WaterToAir HeatPump uns only to meet the sensible cooling load. A supplemental heating coil is required for all dehumidification control types.</p>
<p>The model first calculates the <em>PartLoadRatio</em> required meeting the sensible cooling load.  The heatpump’s sensible cooling load is determined from the control zone sensible cooling load to the cooling setpoint and the control zone air flow fraction to maintain the dry-bulb temperature setpoint in the control zone:</p>
<div>\[HeatPumpCoolingLoad = \,\frac{{ControlZoneCoolingLoad}}{{ControlZoneAirFlowFraction}}\]</div>

<p>The heatpump’s sensible cooling load to be met and the full load cooling output are used to calculate the sensible the part-load ratio iteratively based on user specified convergence criterion.</p>
<div>\[PartLoadRatio = MAX\left( {0.0,\,\frac{{ABS\left( {HeatPumpCoolingLoad - NoCoolOutput} \right)}}{{ABS\left( {FullCoolOutput - NoCoolOutput} \right)}}} \right)\]</div>

<p>When the heat pumps sensible cooling capacity meets the system sensible cooling load at a given sensible part load ratio, then the Heat pump meets the controlled zone cooling setpoint temperature.  If a moisture (latent) load exists because the control zone humidity has exceeded the setpoint, the total moisture load to be met by the heat pumps (HeatPumpMoistureLoad) is calculated based on the control zone moisture load and the control zone air flow fraction.</p>
<div>\[HeatPumpMoistureLoad = \,\frac{{ControlZoneMoitureLoad}}{{ControlZoneAirFlowFraction}}\]</div>

<p>Then the <em>LatentPartLoadRatio</em> required to meet the high humidity setpoint is calculated as follows:</p>
<div>\[LatentPartLoadRatio = MIN\left( {PL{R_{Min}},\,\frac{{ABS\left( {HeatPumpMoistureLoad - NoLatentOutput} \right)}}{{ABS\left( {FullLatentOutput - NoLatentOutput} \right)}}} \right)\]</div>

<p>The model uses the greater of the two part-load ratios, <em>PartLoadRatio</em> or <em>LatentPartLoadRatio</em>, to determine the operating part-load ratio of the Heat Pump’s DX cooling coil.</p>
<div>\[LatentPartLoadRatio = MAX\left( {PartLoadRatio,\,LatentPartLoadRatio} \right)\]</div>

<p>As previously described, iterations are performed to converge on the solution within the convergence tolerance.</p>

<p><em>FullLatentOutput</em>      =         the Heat Pump’s latent cooling energy rate at full-load conditions, W</p>

<p><em>       =  </em>the minimum part-load ratio, which is usually 0.0. For the case when the latent capacity degradation model is used (Ref: DX Cooling Coil Model), this value is the minimum part-load ratio at which the cooling coil will dehumidify the air.</p>
<p>When the predicted zone air temperature is above the heating setpoint and if there is a dehumidification load, the supplemental heating coil load is required to offset the excess cooling as shown in Figure 236. If the model determines that the LatentPartLoadRatio is to be used as the operating part-load ratio of the heatpump’s cooling coil, the supplemental coil is used to offset the excess sensible capacity provided by the unit. The model first checks the sensible load that exists for the current simulation time step (predicted zone temperature with no HVAC operation compared to the thermostat setpoint temperatures). If a sensible cooling load or no sensible cooling or heating load exists (see Figure 236),  the model calculates the difference between the sensible heating load required to reach or maintain the heating dry-bulb temperature setpoint and the actual sensible cooling energy rate delivered by the heat pump (with LatentPartLoadRatio). In this case, thesupplemental heating coil is used to offset the excess sensible cooling energy provided by the DX cooling coil (if any) that could have caused an overshoot of the heating dry-bulb temperature setpoint. Note that when a humidistat is used and high humidity control is required, the zone dry-bulb temperature will typically move toward the heating temperature setpoint when a high moisture (latent) load exists.</p>

<p>Figure 236. Supplemental heating coil load when predicted zone air temperature is above the heating Setpoint</p>
<p>If a heating load exists (Figure 237), the supplementalheating coil is used to meet the heating coil load and at the same time offset the entire sensible cooling energy rate of the DX cooling coil (to meet the humidistat setpoint). Note that when a heating load exists and high humidity control is required, the heat pump operates at the user-specified cooling air flow rate for the entire simulation time step. As with the fan, and DX cooling coil, report variables associated with supplemental heating coil performance (e.g., heating coil energy, heating coil rate, heating coil gas or electric energy, heating coil runtime fraction, etc.) are managed in the supplemental (heating) coil object.</p>

<h4 id="parameter-estimation-model">Parameter Estimation Model</h4>
<p>The steady state simulation model (Object: AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:WaterToAir) for a water-to-air vapor compression heat pump is described in this section. The model is implemented under the air-loop manager similar to the algorithm discussed under AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump. The heat pump 'coil' objects (Coil:Cooling:WaterToAirHeatPump:ParameterEstimation and
 Coil:Heating:WaterToAirHeatPump:ParameterEstimation) actually consist of a steady state simulation of the unitary heat pump in cooling or heating mode respectively.  This documentation is derived from the Ph.D. dissertation of Hui Jin which is available on the Oklahoma State University web site .  The model parameters, solution technique and solution algorithm are all identical to that of the water to water heat pump.  The only difference between the two models is in the modeling of the water to air heat exchanger.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of this heat exchanger is given by</p>
<div>\[\varepsilon  = 1 - {e^{ - NTU}}\]</div>

<p>Where NTU is defined by</p>

<p>UA for the source side and the load side are two of the parameters estimated in the parameter estimation procedure.</p>
<p>Additional model details and a discussion of the parameters and parameter estimation technique are described in the following section on Water to Water Heat Pumps.</p>
<h3 id="water-to-water-heat-pumps">Water To Water Heat Pumps</h3>
<p>There are two water-water heat pump models available in EnergyPlus which are <strong>parameter estimation based model</strong> and <strong>equation-fit model</strong>. Detailed descriptions of the model are available in the references Tang and Jin</p>
<h3 id="equation-fit-water-to-water-heat-pump-model">Equation Fit Water To Water Heat Pump Model</h3>
<p>This section describes the equation-fit model for water-to-water heat pump.   (Object names: HeatPump:WaterToWater:EquationFit:Cooling &amp; HeatPump:WaterToWater:EquationFit:Heating). This documentation is derived from the M.S. dissertation of Tang (2005) which is available on the Oklahoma State University web site . The model uses four non-dimensional equations or curves to predict the heat pump performance in cooling and heating mode. The methodology involved using the generalized least square method to generate a set of performance coefficients from the catalog data at indicated reference conditions. Then the respective coefficients and indicated reference conditions are used in the model to simulate the heat pump performance. The variables that influenced the water-to-water heat pump performance are load side inlet water temperature, source side inlet temperature, source side water flow rate and load side water flow rate. The governing equations for the cooling and heating mode are as following:</p>
<p>Cooling Mode:</p>
<div>\[\frac{{Q{}_c}}{{Q{}_{c,ref}}} = A1 + A2\left[ {\frac{{T{}_{L,in}}}{{T{}_{ref}}}} \right] + A3\left[ {\frac{{T{}_{S,in}}}{{T{}_{ref}}}} \right] + A4\left[ {\frac{{{{\dot V}_L}}}{{{{\dot V}_{L,ref}}}}} \right] + A5\left[ {\frac{{{{\dot V}_S}}}{{{{\dot V}_{S,ref}}}}} \right]\]</div>

<div>\[Powe{r_c} = \frac{{{Q_c}}}{{CO{P_c}}}\]</div>

<p>Heating Mode:</p>
<div>\[\frac{{{Q_h}}}{{Q{}_{h,ref}}} = C1 + C2\left[ {\frac{{T{}_{L,in}}}{{T{}_{ref}}}} \right] + C3\left[ {\frac{{T{}_{S,in}}}{{T{}_{ref}}}} \right] + C4\left[ {\frac{{{{\dot V}_L}}}{{{{\dot V}_{L,ref}}}}} \right] + C5\left[ {\frac{{{{\dot V}_S}}}{{{{\dot V}_{S,ref}}}}} \right]\]</div>

<div>\[Powe{r_h} = \frac{{{Q_h}}}{{CO{P_h}}}\]</div>

<p>Assuming no losses, the source side heat transfer rate for cooling and heating mode is calculated as following;</p>
<div>\[{Q_{source,c}} = {Q_c} + Powe{r_c}\]</div>

<div>\[{Q_{source,h}} = {Q_h} - Powe{r_h}\]</div>

<p>If the load side heat transfer rate (<em>Q<sub>c</sub></em> or <em>Q<sub>h</sub></em>) or power consumption (<em>Power<sub>c</sub></em> or <em>Power<sub>h</sub></em>) are less than or equal to zero, then the heat pump is turned off for that simulation time step, a warning is issued, and the simulation continues.</p>
<p>The inlet conditions or variables are divided by the reference conditions. This formulation allows the coefficients to fall into smaller range of values. Moreover, the value of the coefficient indirectly represents the sensitivity of the output to that particular inlet variable.

<p>Extrapolation beyond the catalog data grants the parameter estimation model an upper hand in comparison with the equation fit and deterministic models. However, the detailed model is computationally more intensive. Moreover, when the model is implemented within a transient system simulation program, it may come across figures that are random and unplanned by the manufacturer such as low water flow rates or extreme temperatures. This oddity may result in unrealistic set of results.</p>

<h4 id="control-strategy">Control Strategy:</h4>
<p>Both water-to-water heat pump models; parameter estimation based model and curve-fit model use the “cycle time control logic” developed by Murugappan (2002).</p>
<p>This strategy keeps the heat pump from short-cycling whereby the heat pump will stay on or off for the specified cycle time after switching states. The control logic is identical to the operation of a physical heat pump whereby the heat pump does not switch between on and off instantly. Refer to Muraggapan (2002) for the further details on the control strategy.</p>

<h2 id="variable-refrigerant-flow-heat-pumps">Variable Refrigerant Flow Heat Pumps <a name="VRF"></a></h2>
<p>There are two common types of variable refrigerant flow heat pump systems:</p>
<p>n cooling only or heating only air-conditioning systems (a.k.a. heat pump), or</p>
<p>n heat recovery systems that allow simultaneous cooling and heating</p>
<p>Energyplus models heat pump and heat recovery operating modes as described in the section entitled Variable Refrigerant Flow Heat Pump Model. The variable refrigerant flow model currently supports air-, evaporatively-, or water-cooled condenser equipment. Throughout this section, the term “condenser” refers to the outdoor unit where the compressor is located.</p>
<h3 id="variable-refrigerant-flow-heat-pump-model">Variable Refrigerant Flow Heat Pump Model</h3>
<h4 id="overview_13">Overview</h4>
<p>The figure below schematically depicts the AirConditioner:VariableRefrigerantFlow (VRF AC) system. The outdoor unit is connected directly to the zone terminal units using a zone terminal unit list (ref: ZoneTerminalUnitList). The VRF AC system conditions multiple zones and is controlled by thermostats located in each zone. Zone terminal units operate to meet the zone sensible cooling or sensible heating requirements as determined by the zone thermostat schedule.</p>
<p>When the heat pump does not operate to reclaim waste heat, the VRF AC system can only operate in either cooling <em>or</em> heating mode. Based on the master thermostat priority control selection, the operating mode is determined by polling the appropriate zone(s) served by the VRF HP system. When the system is operating in cooling mode, the cooling coils will be enabled only in the terminal units where zone cooling is required. When the system is operating in heating mode, the heating coils will be enabled only in the terminal units where zone heating is required. Supply air fans will continue to operate if the zone terminal unit’s fan operating mode is set to continuous fan.</p>
<p>When the heat pump does operate to reclaim waste heat, the VRF AC system can simultaneously cool and heat multiple zones. The heat pump will select an operating mode according to the dominant load as reported by the zone thermostat(s). The calculation of the dominant load is based on the master thermostat priority control selection and may either be based on individual zone loads, the number of zones requiring cooling or heating, the master thermostat zone load, or an operating mode schedule. The heat pump will operate in cooling mode, and provide waste heat to zones with a heating load, when the dominant load among all zone terminal units is cooling. The heat pump will operate in heating mode, and absorb heat from zones with a cooling load, when the dominant load among all zone terminal units is heating.</p>
<p>The figure below shows the VRF AC terminal units with draw through fan placement. Blow through fan placement can also be modeled by connecting the supply air fan inlet node to the outside air mixer’s mixed air node if an outdoor air mixer is used or to the zone terminal unit inlet node if an outdoor air mixer is not used. The variable refrigerant flow heat pump coordinates the operation of these components and is modeled as a type of zone equipment where the <em>zone terminal units</em> are specified in a zone equipment list (Ref. ZoneHVAC: EquipmentList and ZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnections). The AirConditioner: VariableRefrigerantFlow object <em>is not</em> specified in an air primary loop or a zone equipment list object.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../EngineeringReference/media/image5315.png" /></p>

<p><img alt="" src="../../EngineeringReference/media/image5316.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 243. Variable Refrigerant Flow object connections in Energyplus</p>
<p>The terminal unit is able to model supply air fan operation in two modes: cycling fan – cycling coil (i.e., AUTO fan) and continuous fan – cycling coil (i.e., fan ON). Fan:Simple:OnOff must be used to model AUTO fan, while Fan:Simple:OnOff or Fan:Simple:ConstVolume can be used to model fan ON.</p>
<p>Output variables reported by the VRF AC object include the heat pump’s operating capacity (cooling or heating), electric consumption, operating COP, defrost electric consumption, part-load ratio (ratio of actual capacity to available capacity), runtime fraction (when cycling), cycling ratio (actual compressor cycling rate), crankcase heater power, and other report variables associated with an evaporative condenser. Report variables are also available to indicate the maximum available terminal unit cooling or heating capacity (i.e., when the condensers available capacity is insufficient to supply the capacity requested by all terminal units). Reporting of other variables of interest for the VRF AC (fan electric power, DX coil cooling rate, DX coil heating rate, terminal unit total cooling rate, etc.) is done by the individual system components (e.g., fan, DX cooling coil, DX heating coil, and zone terminal unit). For convenience, the total cooling and heating coil capacities (i.e., the coil loads) is also reported.</p>
<h4 id="model-description_8">Model Description</h4>
<p>As described previously, the VRF AC system conditions multiple zones and is controlled by one or more zone thermostats (ZoneControl:Thermostatic). Each simulation time step, EnergyPlus performs a zone air heat balance to determine if cooling or heating is required to meet each zone’s thermostat set point. When heat pump mode is selected (i.e., heat recovery is not selected), an operating mode is chosen based on the master thermostat priority control and all terminal units are operated in that specific mode. When heat recovery mode is selected, the dominant load is determined based on the master thermostat priority control and the outdoor unit operates in this mode. The indoor terminal units operate in either cooling or heating mode based on the individual coil loads The heat pump condenser is then modeled to determine any impact the condensing unit might have on the zone terminal units (i.e., capacity limitations due to oversized terminal units, operating limitations due to allowable operating temperature range, impacts of defrost operation, changes in performance when heat recovery mode is active, etc.). The following sections describe the performance calculations for cooling and heating.</p>
<h4 id="cooling-operation_3">Cooling Operation</h4>
<p>The operating capacity of the heat pump is calculated based on the user defined input for the heat pump’s rated cooling capacity, the ratio of indoor terminal unit capacity to outdoor unit capacity (combination ratio), the actual operating conditions, and whether or not the system’s heat recovery mode is active. Performance correction factors are used to correct for off-design performance as follows:</p>
<h4 id="cooling-combination-ratio-correction-factor">Cooling Combination Ratio Correction Factor</h4>
<p>The cooling combination ratio correction factor is defined as the total terminal unit rated cooling capacity divided by the heat pump’s rated cooling capacity. The combination ratio is important when multiple terminal units (or DX coils) are attached to a single variable-speed condensing unit. If the combination ratio is less than 1, the condenser’s rated capacity is assumed to be able to meet the indoor terminal unit’s demand request. However, if the combination ratio is determined to be greater than 1, the maximum cooling capacity available from the heat pump’s condenser may be higher than the user specified rated cooling capacity. The combination ratio capacity correction factor is based on a linear, quadratic or cubic curve and provides a multiplier &gt; 1 to correct for combination ratio’s greater than 1. For example, a combination ratio of 1.3 (130%) may result in a combination ratio capacity correction factor of 1.06 (outdoor condenser can actually provide 106% of rated capacity) . The cooling combination ratio correction factor is applied to cooling performance calculations. If the cooling combination ratio correction curve name is not specified by the user, the cooling combination ratio correction factor (CR <sub>cooling,\ correction</sub>) in the following equation is assumed to be equal to 1.</p>

<h4 id="using-multiple-curves-to-define-cooling-capacity-ratio-modifier">Using multiple curves to define Cooling Capacity Ratio Modifier</h4>
<p>The cooling capacity ratio modifier determines the change in total (sensible + latent) capacity with respect to the heat pump rated cooling capacity. This modifier corrects for off-design performance and provides the operating total (sensible + latent) cooling capacity for the heat pump condenser. The performance data for VRF AC systems may be specified using a single curve object, however, if the performance data does not reflect a smooth change in performance as outdoor conditions vary, the overall performance of the system may be described using two cooling capacity ratio modifier curves (i.e., a separate curve at low and high outdoor temperatures) and a boundary curve (i.e., the curve defining the separation at specific outdoor temperatures).</p>
<h4 id="application-of-dual-performance-curves">Application of Dual Performance Curves</h4>
<p>Two additional inputs are available to more accurately model the cooling performance of a VRF AC system. The first additional input is a boundary curve which is used to distinguish differences in performance at “low” and “high” outdoor temperature regions and the second input is a cooling capacity performance curve for the “high” outdoor temperature region. The boundary curve is a linear, quadratic or cubic curve defining the outdoor temperature as a function of average indoor wet-bulb temperature. The cooling capacity ratio function of high temperature curve is a biquadratic curve using average indoor wet-bulb temperature and outdoor dry-bulb temperature as the two independent variables. These additional curves are used to define the performance over two separate performance regions as shown in Figure 244. The red circles in the figure identify the points at which the performance changes abruptly (i.e., slopes or shapes are significantly different) and are used to create the boundary curve. The performance on either side of the boundary curve can be a smooth curve changing with outdoor condition or a flat plateau where system controls maintain a constant operating condition. This type of performance cannot be accurately simulated using a single performance curve object. For this reason, dual capacity performance curves may be used.</p>
<p>Note: If the cooling performance can be described using a single performance curve object, the boundary and high temperature performance curve objects are not required.</p>
<p>Manufacturers may also provide this information in a tabular format. In this case the data should first be graphically displayed to identify any non-linearities and to also identify where an abrupt change in performance occurs so that a boundary curve can be created.</p>
<p>The cooling capacity ratio boundary curve object is used to differentiate between dual cooling capacity ratio performance curves. This curve defines the outdoor temperature below which the cooling capacity ratio function of low temperature curve object is used, otherwise, the cooling capacity ratio function of high temperature curve object is used.</p>
<div>\[{T_{OA,DB}} = a + b\left( {{T_{I,WB}}} \right) + c{\left( {{T_{I,WB}}} \right)^2} + d{\left( {{T_{I,WB}}} \right)^3}\]</div>

<p>where</p>
<p>T<sub>OA,DB</sub> = Outside air dry-bulb temperature (C)</p>
<p>a-d = coefficients for cooling capacity ratio boundary curve object</p>
<p>T<sub>I,WB</sub> = Weighted average indoor wet-bulb temperature (C)</p>
<p>For the performance data shown below, the boundary curve would be created by identifying the outdoor dry-bulb temperature at which the performance changed abruptly for each of the indoor wet-bulb temperature curves shown in the figure. The following example shows the data interpreted from the figure used to regress the cooling capacity ratio boundary curve coefficients. For this example, the regression coefficients were found to be: A1 = 29.87396, B1 = -0.6928, C1= 0.01928, D1 = -0.000532</p>
<p>Table 73. Performance Data for Variable Refrigerant Flow Air Conditioner Model</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../EngineeringReference/media/image5339.svg" /></p>
<p>Although the capacity and energy performance curves each have an independent boundary curve input, in this example the same boundary curve may be used for both the capacity and energy input ratio curves. When the “low” and “high” predicted performance data do not line up at the boundary curve points, the boundary curve may have to be modified slightly to allow a smooth transition in performance from the “low” to “high” temperature region. In this case, the boundary curves for capacity and energy may be different.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../EngineeringReference/media/image5340.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 244. Non-Linear Performance of VRF Heat Pump in Cooling Mode</p>
<p>A regression is then performed on the data to the left of the boundary curve to calculate the low temperature cooling performance curve coefficients. A regression is also performed on the data to the right of the boundary curve to create the high temperature cooling performance curve coefficients. The model then uses the boundary curve to determine which performance curve (low or high) to use during the simulation. For example, given a particular average indoor wet-bulb temperature, if the boundary curve object calculates an outdoor dry-bulb temperature that is above the actual outdoor dry-bulb temperature then the cooling capacity ratio function of low temperature performance curve is used to determine AC system performance for that specific simulation time step. When creating the boundary curve, be careful to make sure the low and high performance curves meet, as closely as possible, at the boundary curve points (i.e., that discontinuities do not exist or are minimized to the extent possible). Tabular data (ref: Table:TwoIndependentVariables) may also be used to specify performance and will usually eliminate the need for dual performance curves.</p>
<h4 id="determining-cooling-coil-sensible-capacity">Determining Cooling Coil Sensible Capacity</h4>
<p>The zone terminal unit’s cooling coil is controlled by a zone thermostat and must meet a zone “sensible” load. The cooling coil’s sensible capacity is defined as the cooling coil’s total capacity multiplied by the coil’s sensible heat ratio (SHR) at the current operation conditions. Since the SHR of the variable refrigerant flow cooling coil changes as the inlet air wet-bulb temperature and the operating part-load ratio change, an iterative solution technique must be used to determine the coil’s sensible capacity. The target solution is found when the sensible capacity of the zone cooling coil equals the zone sensible cooling load (if sufficient capacity is available). The iterative solution converges when the difference (error) between the zone sensible cooling load and the terminal unit sensible cooling capacity is within tolerance (0.001) or the terminal unit has insufficient capacity to meet the zone sensible cooling load. Refer to the description of the VRF cooling coil model for further details (ref: Variable Refrigerant Flow Cooling Coil).</p>

<h4 id="cooling-piping-correction-factor-in-cooling-mode">Cooling Piping Correction Factor in cooling mode</h4>
<p>The cooling piping correction factor is calculated using either one or two independent variables. Both the equivalent piping length and the combination ratio are used together to determine piping losses, or the equivalent piping length itself is used. The vertical height specified by the user is also added to the result calculated by either. If a single independent variable is used, a linear, quadratic, or cubic equation is used to determine the equivalent length correction factor. If two independent variables are used, a biquadratic equation is used to determine the equivalent length correction factor. The program will automatically use the correct equation based on the performance curve type. In either case, a single coefficient adjusts the piping correction factor based on the difference in height from the highest to lowest terminal unit. Coefficients a-d (e) in the following equation(s) are inputs in the piping correction factor for length in cooling mode performance curve object. Coefficient f is a direct input to the VRF model as the piping correction factor for height in cooling mode coefficient. The equivalent piping length in cooling mode (P<sub>EQ,cooling</sub>) is also a direct input in the VRF model. The cooling combination ratio (CR<sub>cooling</sub>) is automatically calculated by the program. The vertical height, the difference between the highest and lowest terminal unit (e.g., 12 m higher than condenser – 3 m lower than condenser = 9 m height), is a common input for both cooling and heating. When all terminal units are above or below the outdoor unit, an average positive or negative value is used.

<h4 id="heat-recovery-cooling-capacity-modifier">Heat Recovery Cooling Capacity Modifier</h4>
<p>When operating in heat recovery mode, the heat pump’s available cooling capacity is typically different than the available capacity when operating in cooling only mode.

<p>This equation can be used to provide a constant fractional difference for available cooling capacity in heat recovery mode (i.e., only <em>a</em> is non-zero) or a fractional term that varies with indoor and outdoor conditions.

<h4 id="transition-from-cooling-only-mode-to-heat-recovery-mode">Transition from Cooling Only mode to Heat Recovery mode</h4>
<p>When the VRF system transitions from cooling only operation to heat recovery operation, this transition takes some finite amount of time. During the transition period the available cooling capacity can change significantly, The following figure illustrates the transition between cooling only mode and heat recovery mode. For this test, the VRF system was turned on and allowed to reach steady-state operation. Three of the four indoor terminal units were operating in cooling mode, When the fourth terminal unit was enabled in heating mode, the transition from cooling only mode to heat recovery mode took approximately 45 minutes. During this time, the available cooling is significantly reduced and recovers over time. When the system again reaches steady-state operation, the available cooling capacity and power consumption are markedly different. Although computer models do not typically simulate this type of transitional performance, efforts to model this aspect of performance were included in the VRF AC heat recovery model. The initial heat recovery cooling capacity fraction and heat recovery cooling capacity time constant are used to model this transition period. The initial heat recovery cooling capacity fraction identifies the fraction of available heat recovery mode cooling capacity at the start of the transition period, the heat recovery cooling capacity time constant identifies the time needed to recover to 99% of the steady-state value. This exponential model used for simulating the transition period can be turned off by setting the initial heat recovery cooling capacity fraction to 1.</p>

<h4 id="heat-recovery-cooling-capacity-fraction-and-time-constant">Heat Recovery Cooling Capacity Fraction and Time Constant</h4>
<p>When the heat pump changes operating modes (i.e., from cooling only to heat recovery mode), the transition does not happen immediately. There is a time delay, and a period of time where the available cooling capacity is well below the steady-state capacity available after the system has had time to adjust. When this type of transition is modeled, an exponential decay curve is used. At the start of the transition period, only a fraction (<em>k<sub>cool</sub></em>) of the steady-state capacity in heat recovery mode is available. The remaining capacity is recovered over a period of 5 time constants (t<sub>c</sub>) and is modeled with the following equation. This equation was used to replicate both the cooling capacity and condenser power curves in the previous figure.</p>
<div>\[{\mathop Q\limits^ \bullet_{HR,avail,\,cooling}} = {k_{cool}}\left( {{{\mathop Q\limits^ \bullet  }_{HR,cooling,\,total}}} \right) + \left( {1 - {k_{cool}}} \right)\left( {{{\mathop Q\limits^ \bullet  }_{HR,cooling,\,total}}} \right)\left( {1 - {e^{\left( {{\raise0.7ex\hbox{${ - t}$} \!\mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{ - t} {{\tau_c}}}}\right.}\!\lower0.7ex\hbox{${{\tau_c}}$}}} \right)}}} \right)\]</div>

<p>The heat pump total available cooling capacity must be greater than or equal to the total cooling capacity requested by the zone terminal units. When the total operating capacity of all terminal unit’s will be greater than the available operating capacity of the heat pump condenser, one or more of the terminal unit’s operating capacity must be reduced to the point where the sum of the indoor terminal unit demand request plus piping losses is equal to the total available cooling capacity of the outdoor condenser. At this point, the part-load ratio of the heat pump condenser will be equal to 1.</p>
<p>A maximum terminal unit cooling capacity limit is used to restrict the cooling capacity of each indoor terminal unit. The capacity limit is equivalent to a maximum allowed operating capacity for all zone terminal units. This limit is used to conserve energy between multiple indoor terminal units and a single outdoor condensing unit. Assuming no terminal unit can provide more capacity than can be delivered by the outdoor condenser, the terminal unit total cooling capacity calculation previously discussed is revised as follows:</p>
<div>\[{\mathop Q\limits^ \bullet_{coil(i),\,\,cooling}} = \sum\limits_1^i {MIN\left( {\left( {{{\mathop Q\limits^ \bullet  }_{coil(i),cooling,total}}} \right)\left( {PLR(i)} \right),\,\,CoolingCapacityLimit} \right)} \]</div>

<p>When multiple terminal units are operating, the terminal units near their maximum capacity are more likely to be capacity limited than those terminal units operating well below their available capacity. The assumption here is that terminal units that are not capacity limited can provide more refrigerant to meet the same load. When the model finds that there is no terminal unit capacity limit, this variable will report 1E+20 indicating that no limit exists.  The figure below demonstrates the application of the capacity limit factor for the case where all indoor terminal units are operating at different capacities. A solution is reached when the sum of the indoor terminal unit’s cooling capacities (accounting for piping losses) is equal to the heat pump condenser’s available cooling capacity.</p>

<p>Figure 248. Example of Cooling Capacity Limit</p>
<p>When the heat pump’s part-load ratio is less than 1 (i.e., the total capacity of all terminal unit’s is less than the actual operating capacity of the heat pump condenser), the heat pump’s part-load ratio is compared to the minimum heat pump part-load ratio. If the heat pump’s part-load ratio is less than the minimum heat pump part-load ratio, the heat pump will cycle on and off to meet the cooling load. A correction factor is used to account for startup losses of the compression system.</p>
<p><strong><em>Cooling Part-Load Fraction Correlation (function of cycling ratio)</em></strong></p>
<p>The cooling part-load fraction correlation (function of heat pump cycling ratio) is a linear, quadratic or cubic curve with the independent variable being cycling ratio (part-load ratio / minimum part-load ratio). The output of this curve is used in combination with the rated EIR and EIR modifier curves to give the “effective” EIR for a given simulation time step.</p>
<div>\[CyclingRatioFrac = a + b\left( {CyclingRatio} \right) + c{\left( {CyclingRatio} \right)^2} + d{\left( {CyclingRatio} \right)^3}\]</div>

<p>a-c (d) = coefficients for the quadratic (cubic) cycling ratio correlation curve equation</p>
<p>The cycling ratio can be viewed using the report variable “VRF Heat Pump Cycling Ratio” (ref: Output:Variable).</p>
<p>The cooling part-load ratio correlation should be normalized to a value of 1.0 when the cycling ratio equals 1.0 (i.e., no efficiency losses when the heat pump runs continuously [PLR ≥ PLR<sub>min</sub>] for the simulation time step). For cycling ratio values between 0 and 1 (0 &lt;= CyclingRatio &lt; 1), the following rules apply:</p>
<p>CyclingRatioFrac &gt;= 0.7   and   CyclingRatioFrac &gt;= CyclingRatio</p>
<p>If CyclingRatioFrac &lt; 0.7 a warning message is issued, the program resets the CyclingRatioFrac value to 0.7, and the simulation proceeds. The runtime fraction of the heat pump is defined as CyclingRatio/CyclingRatioFrac. If CyclingRatioFrac &lt; CyclingRatio, the runtime fraction will exceed 1. In this case a warning message is issued and the runtime fraction of the heat pump is limited to 1.0.</p>
<div>\[Heat\,Pump\,Runtime\,Fraction\,(HPRTF) = {\raise0.7ex\hbox{${CyclingRatio}$} \!\mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{CyclingRatio} {CyclingRatioFrac}}}\right.}\!\lower0.7ex\hbox{${CyclingRatioFrac}$}}\]</div>

<p>The heat pump runtime fraction can be viewed using the report variable “VRF Heat Pump Runtime Fraction” (ref: Output:Variable).</p>
<p>Since manufacturers data do not typically provide information defining the cycling losses of VRF AC systems, a typical part-load fraction correlation for a conventional DX refrigeration system (e.g., residential or small commercial unit) may be substituted here as:</p>
<p>CyclingRatioFrac = 0.85 + 0.15(CyclingRatio)</p>
<p>The electrical power consumed by the heat pump condenser is then calculated based on the heat pump’s rated electric power consumption (including condenser fan power), the actual operating conditions, and the cycling ratio of the refrigeration system. Performance correction factors are used here to correct for off-design performance as follows:</p>

<p>Calculations of the heat pump’s heating performance is nearly identical to the calculations described above for cooling operation.</p>
<p>The sum of the individual zone total heating requirements are used to calculate the performance of the outdoor condensing unit. The operating capacity of the indoor heating coils are calculated based on the indoor heating coil’s nominal heating capacity and the actual operating conditions. A capacity correction factor is used to correct for off-design performance as follows:</p>
<p><strong><em>Heating Combination Ratio Correction Factor (function of capacity ratio)</em></strong></p>
<p>The heating combination ratio correction factor is defined as the total terminal unit rated heating capacity divided by the heat pump’s rated heating capacity. In some instances, the cooling combination ratio may be used to define the correction factor used to modify the heat pump’s rated heating capacity and is manufacturer specific. The combination ratio is important when multiple terminal units (or DX coils) are attached to a single variable-speed condensing unit. If the combination ratio is less than 1, the condenser has sufficient capacity to meet the indoor terminal unit’s capacity request. However, if the combination ratio is determined to be greater than 1, the maximum heating capacity available from the heat pump’s condenser may be higher than the user specified rated heating capacity. The combination ratio capacity correction factor is based on a linear, quadratic or cubic curve and provides a multiplier &gt; 1 to correct for combination ratio’s greater than 1. For example, a combination ratio of 1.3 (130%) may result in a combination ratio capacity correction factor of 1.06 (outdoor condenser can actually provide 106% of rated capacity) . The heating combination ratio correction factor is applied to heating performance calculations.

<p>When operating in heat recovery mode, the heat pump’s available heating capacity is typically different than the available capacity when operating in heating only mode.

<p>When the VRF system transitions from heating only operation to heat recovery operation, this transition takes some finite amount of time. During the transition period the available heating capacity can change significantly, As described for the transition from cooling only operating to heat recovery mode, the initial heat recovery heating capacity fraction and heat recovery heating capacity time constant are used to model the transition from heating only mode to heat recovery mode. The initial heat recovery heating capacity fraction identifies the fraction of available heat recovery mode heating capacity at the start of the transition period, the heat recovery heating capacity time constant identifies the time needed to recover to 99% of the steady-state value. This exponential model used for modeling the transition period can be turned off by setting the initial heat recovery heating capacity fraction to 1.0.</p>

<p>When the heat pump changes operating modes (i.e., from heating only to heat recovery mode), the transition does not happen immediately. There is a time delay, and a period of time where the available heating capacity is different from the steady-state capacity available after the system has had time to adjust. When this type of transition is modeled, an exponential decay curve is used. At the start of the transition period, only a fraction (<em>k<sub>heat</sub></em>) of the steady-state capacity in heat recovery mode is available.

<p>The heat pump’s total (gross) heating capacity is then calculated based on the capacity correction factor as a function of temperatures.

<p>= heating capacity correction factor for defrost mode</p>
<p>As described for cooling operation, the available heating capacity of the heat pump is compared to the requested heating capacity of all indoor terminal units. If the requested heating capacity of all indoor terminal units is greater than the available heating capacity of the heat pump, one or more of the indoor terminal unit’s capacity is limited such that the sum of the zone terminal unit heating demand plus piping losses is equal to the available heat pump heating capacity (including the impact due to defrost).</p>
<p>The electrical power consumed by the heat pump condenser is calculated based on the heat pump’s nominal electric power consumption in heating mode and the actual operating conditions. A performance correction factor is used to correct for off-design performance as follows:</p>
<p>Heating Part-Load Fraction Correlation (function of heat pump cycling ratio)</p>
<p>The part-load fraction correlation (function of heat pump cycling ratio) is a linear, quadratic or a cubic curve with the independent variable being cycling ratio (part-load ratio / minimum part-load ratio). The output of this curve is used in combination with the rated EIR and EIR modifier curves to give the “effective” EIR for a given simulation time step. The cycling ratio correlation accounts for startup losses of the heat pump’s compression system.</p>
<div>\[CyclingRatioFrac = a + b\left( {CyclingRatio} \right) + c{\left( {CyclingRatio} \right)^2}\]</div>

<p>or</p>

<p>The cycling ratio can be viewed using the report variable “VRF Heat Pump Cycling Ratio” (ref: Output:Variable).</p>
<p>The cycling ratio correlation should be normalized to a value of 1.0 when the cycling ratio equals 1.0 (i.e., no efficiency losses when the compressor(s) run continuously for the simulation time step). For cycling ratio values between 0 and 1 (0 &lt;= CyclingRatio &lt; 1), the following rules apply:</p>
<p>CyclingRatioFrac &gt;= 0.7   and   CyclingRatioFrac &gt;= CyclingRatio</p>
<p>If CyclingRatioFrac &lt; 0.7 a warning message is issued, the program resets the CyclingRatioFrac value to 0.7, and the simulation proceeds. The runtime fraction of the heat pump is defined as CyclingRatio/CyclingRatioFrac. If CyclingRatioFrac &lt; CyclingRatio, then a warning message is issued and the runtime fraction of the heat pump is limited to 1.0.</p>
<div>\[Heat\,Pump\,Runtime\,Fraction\left( {HPRTF} \right) = {\raise0.7ex\hbox{${CyclingRatio}$} \!\mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{CyclingRatio} {CyclingRatioFrac}}}\right.}\!\lower0.7ex\hbox{${CyclingRatioFrac}$}}\]</div>

<p>The heat pump runtime fraction can be viewed using the report variable “VRF Heat Pump Runtime Fraction” (ref: Output:Variable).</p>
<p>Since manufacturers data do not typically provide information defining the cycling losses of VRF AC systems, a typical part-load fraction correlation for a conventional DX refrigeration system (e.g., residential or small commercial unit) may be substituted here as:</p>

<p>This equation can be used to provide a constant fractional difference for heating electric consumption rate in heat recovery mode (i.e., only <em>a</em> is non-zero) or a fractional term that varies with indoor and outdoor conditions. With very limited performance data available at this time, it is recommended that only the constant (a) term be used at this time.

When heat recovery is used, one or both of these terms can be non-zero, therefore, the operating COP includes recovered energy.

<h4 id="defrost-adjustment-factors">Defrost Adjustment Factors</h4>
<p>Frost formation on the outdoor coil, and the need to periodically defrost this coil, has a significant impact on heating capacity and energy use by the DX heating system. This model uses a timed reverse-cycle defrost model. If the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature is below the specified maximum temperature for defrost operation, then the model calculates adjustment factors for heating capacity and input power due to frost formation This method of accounting for the impacts of frosting/defrost was taken from the model used in DOE-2.1E (ESTSC 2001, Miller and Jaster 1985).</p>
<p>The model first estimates the outdoor coil temperature according to a linear empirical relationship with outdoor air dry-bulb temperature as the independent variable.</p>

<p>The difference between the outdoor air humidity ratio (from the weather file) and the saturated air humidity ratio at the estimated outdoor coil temperature is then calculated, and this value is used as an indication of frost formation on the outdoor coil.</p>

<p>Frost formation on the outdoor coil must be periodically removed. The fraction of compressor runtime when the coil is being defrosted is entered by the user.

Up to 20 terminal units may be connected to a single VRF outdoor condensing unit. This list is extensible if additional indoor terminal units are required. The following figure shows the connection scheme between the zone terminal units, the zone terminal unit list, and finally the VRF AC system. The zone terminal units are connected to the zone through zone inlet and outlet zone nodes.

<h4 id="overview_14">Overview</h4>
<p>The input object HeatExchanger:AirToAir:SensibleAndLatent provides a model for a generic, sensible and latent air-to-air heat exchanger that is an HVAC air system component that consists of a heat exchanger and primary/secondary airflow bypass dampers. The specific configuration of the component is shown in the following figure.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../EngineeringReference/media/image5455.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 250. Schematic of the Sensible and Latent Air-to-Air Heat Exchanger</p>
<p>The sensible and latent air-to-air heat exchanger is typically used for exhaust or relief air heat recovery. Heat exchanger performance can be specified to transfer sensible energy, latent energy or both between the supply and exhaust air streams. The input requires no geometric data. Performance is defined by specifying sensible and/or latent effectiveness at 75% and 100% of the nominal (rated) supply air flow rate in both heating and cooling conditions (Table 74).</p>

<p>0.6°C (33°F)</p>

<p>14°C (58°F)</p>
<p>24°C (75°F)</p>
<p>17°C (63°F)</p>
<p>Note: Conditions consistent with the Air-Conditioning and Refrigeration Institute’s Standard 1060 (ARI 2001).</p>
<p>Heat exchange between the supply and exhaust air streams occurs whenever the unit is scheduled to be available (availability schedule) and supply/exhaust air flows are present. This heat exchanger object can be used in conjunction with a conventional air-side economizer (i.e., specify an appropriate economizer control type in the Controller:OutdoorAir object), whereby heat exchange is suspended whenever the air-side economizer is active (i.e., air flow is fully bypassed around a fixed-plate heat exchanger or the rotation of a rotary heat exchanger is stopped). This object is also able to suspend heat exchange for the purpose of providing free cooling operation in the absence of a conventional air-side economizer (i.e., specify MinimumFlowWithBypass in the Controller:Outside Air object). Suspension of heat exchange during economizer mode may be customized as necessary using the economizer lockout field. Note that the Economizer Type must be set to something other than NoEconomizer for this control interaction to function.</p>
<p>Several methods of frost control are available to warm the heat exchanger core to prevent frost formation. Available methods are preheat, exhaust only, exhaust air recirculation, and minimum exhaust temperature. Preheat frost control uses a separate heater object placed in the supply inlet air stream to keep the air temperature above the frost threshold temperature. All other frost control methods are modeled within this heat exchanger object.</p>
<p>This heat exchanger object can also control the supply air outlet temperature to a setpoint when a setpoint manager and temperature schedule are used. This temperature control is accomplished through wheel speed modulation or bypassing supply air around the heat exchanger to maintain the desired setpoint and avoid overheating the supply air.</p>
<h4 id="model-description_9">Model Description</h4>
<p>The heat exchanger object models energy transfer between the supply air stream and the exhaust air stream according to the effectiveness values that are specified by the user in the input data file (see IO Reference Document, HeatExchanger:AirToAir:SensibleAndLatent). The operating volumetric air flow rate through the heat exchanger (i.e., the average of the actual supply and exhaust air flow rates for the simulation time step) should be between 50% and 130% of the nominal supply air flow rate specified for the heat exchanger. Operating air flow rates outside this range result in a warning message and a recommendation to adjust air flow rates to within the appropriate range.</p>
<p>The user must enter the sensible and latent effectiveness of the heat exchanger for heating and cooling conditions (Table 74) with balanced air flow (supply flow equal to the exhaust flow) at two flow rates: 75% and 100% of the nominal supply air flow rate. Heat exchanger manufacturers can typically provide this performance information, and it is also available for equipment contained in ARI’s Certified Product Directory for Air-to-Air Energy Recovery Ventilation Equipment (ARI 2003). Values may be entered for sensible effectiveness, latent effectiveness, or both. The model assumes default values of 0.0 for sensible and latent effectiveness, thus requiring the user to input representative values for the heat exchanger being modeled.</p>
<p>To obtain the “operating” effectiveness of the heat exchanger at different air flow rates, the model first calculates the average volumetric air flow rate through the heat exchanger (average of the supply and exhaust air flow rates) for each simulation time step. Air flows through the heat exchanger may be unbalanced (supply greater than exhaust, or vice versa), but an unbalanced air flow ratio greater than 2:1 is not recommended  (beyond this range a warning message is issued). The model determines the operating effectiveness of the heat exchanger by linear interpolation or extrapolation of the 100% flow and 75% flow effectiveness values specified in the input data file, using the average volumetric air flow rate through the heat exchanger. Extrapolation is allowed down to 50% and up to 130% of the nominal supply air flow rate (beyond this range a warning message is issued).</p>

<div>\[{\mathop Q\limits^ \bullet_{Total}} = {\mathop m\limits^ \bullet_{SupAir}}({h_{SupAirIn}} - {h_{SupAirOut}})\]</div>

<p>where:</p>
<div>\[{\mathop Q\limits^ \bullet_{Sensible}}\]</div>

<p>= sensible heat recovery rate (W)</p>

<p>= mass flow rate of the supply air stream (kg/s)</p>
<p>The conditions of the exhaust (secondary) air leaving the heat exchanger are then calculated:</p>
<div>\[{T_{ExhAirOut}} = {T_{ExhAirIn}}\, + \,\,\frac{{{{\mathop Q\limits^ \bullet  }_{Sensible}}}}{{\mathop m\limits^ \bullet  cp,exh}}\]</div>

<div>\[{h_{ExhAirOut}} = {h_{ExhAirIn}}\, + \,\,\frac{{\mathop Q\limits^ \bullet  {\,_{Total}}}}{{{{\mathop m\limits^ \bullet  }_{_{ExhAir}}}}}\]</div>

<div>\[{\omega_{ExhAirOut}} = PsyWFnTdbH({T_{ExhAirOut}},{h_{ExhAirOut}})\]</div>

<p><em>where</em>:</p>
<p><em>T<sub>ExhAirOut</sub></em><sub>                     </sub> = exhaust air temperature leaving the heat exchanger (°C)</p>
<p><em>h<sub>ExhAirOut</sub></em>           = exhaust air enthalpy leaving the heat exchanger (J/kg)</p>
<div img="image5483.txt">\({\mathop m\limits^ \bullet_{ExhAir}}\)</div>

<p>= exhaust air humidity ratio leaving the heat exchanger (kg/kg)</p>
<p><em>PsyWFnTdbH</em> = psychrometric routine calculating air humidity ratio as a function of</p>
<p>temperature and enthalpy</p>
<p>As was done for the supply air, calculated exhaust air conditions beyond the saturation curve are reset to saturation conditions at the calculated air enthalpy value.</p>
<p>Once the air conditions leaving each side of the heat exchanger (supply and exhaust) are calculated, this air is blended with any bypass air that was directed around the heat exchanger core to determine the final air conditions leaving the heat exchanger unit. These outlet air conditions are used in Equations and to determine the sensible and total heat recovery rate for the overall heat exchanger unit. The latent heat recovery rate for the overall unit is then calculated as the difference between the total and sensible heat recovery rates:</p>
<div>\[{\mathop Q\limits^ \bullet_{Latent}} = {\mathop Q\limits^ \bullet_{Total}}\,\, - \,{\mathop {\,Q}\limits^ \bullet_{Sensible}}\]</div>

<p>Heat recovery electric power is the electric consumption rate of the unit in watts. The nominal electric power rate for the heat exchanger is specified in the input data file, and can be used to model controls (transformers, relays, etc.) and/or a motor for a rotary heat exchanger. The model assumes that this electric power is consumed whenever the heat exchanger is scheduled to operate and supply/exhaust air flow rates exist. The electric power is assumed to be zero for all other times or if heat exchange is suspended to provide free cooling (economizer operation). None of this electric power is assumed to contribute thermal load to either of the heat exchanger air streams.</p>
<p>At the end of each HVAC simulation time step, this object reports the sensible, latent and total heat recovery rates for the overall unit as calculated above. The heat recovery rates are reported separately for times when the supply air is heated and when it is cooled (Ref: HeatExchanger:AirToAir:SensibleAndLatent in the EnergyPlus Input Output Reference). The heat recovery electric power is also reported for each simulation time step. In addition to the heat recovery rates and electric power, heating/cooling energy transferred to the supply air and the electric energy consumption by the heat exchanger unit are calculated for the time step being reported as follows:</p>

<h4 id="frost-control-methods">Frost Control Methods</h4>
<p>In cold weather, frost can form on the heat exchanger causing a reduction in air flow and heat recovery performance. Various strategies can be employed to limit frost formation. Heat exchangers that transfer total energy (sensible plus latent) usually have a lower frost threshold temperature than sensible-only heat exchangers. Frost threshold temperatures for sensible-only heat exchangers may be -1°C to -12°C for plate and rotary heat exchangers respectively, while those for comparable total (sensible plus latent) heat exchangers may be 10°C lower. The frost threshold temperature for a specific application is dependent on the exhaust air dry-bulb temperature and relative humidity, heat exchanger type (e.g., sensible-only or total heat exchange, flat plate or rotary), and the heat exchanger effectiveness. Consult manufacturer’s literature to obtain specific frost threshold temperatures for the heat exchanger being modeled.</p>
<p>Four frost control strategies can be modeled for this air-to-air heat exchanger unit. Each of these four strategies is discussed in detail below.</p>
<h4 id="preheat">Preheat</h4>
<p>One method to control frost formation is to preheat the cold outdoor (supply) air entering the heat exchanger. When a preheat coil is used for frost control, a separate heating coil object must be placed in the supply air stream at the inlet to the heat exchanger (Coil:Heating:Water, Coil:Heating:Electric or Coil:Heating:Gas). The preheat coil should be controlled to maintain a minimum supply air inlet temperature thereby eliminating frost buildup on the heat exchanger core. When modeling preheat frost control, specify “None” as the frost control method in the heat exchanger object. When modeling this heat exchanger as part of an air loop, refer to the objects AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem and SetpointManager:Scheduled the EnergyPlus Input Output Reference for additional information on specifying a preheat coil and controlling its supply air temperature.This frost control method is not currently available when this heat exchanger is being used as part of the compound object ZoneHVAC:EnergyRecoveryVentilator.</p>
<h4 id="exhaust-only">Exhaust Only</h4>
<p>This method of frost control bypasses the incoming supply air around the heat exchanger core thereby warming the core using the exiting exhaust air. This method is similar to ‘supply air off’ frost control where the supply air fan is turned off for a predetermined period of time while the exhaust air fan continues to operate. For the ‘supply air off’ method, the supply air flow is stopped for a period of time thereby reducing the ventilation air supplied to the zone(s). In addition, the building may be negatively pressurized for the period of time that the supply air flow is stopped since the exhaust air fan continues to operate. On the other hand, the ‘exhaust only’ method of frost control modeled by EnergyPlus continues to provide outdoor ventilation air to the zone(s), but this air is simply bypassed around the heat exchanger core for a portion of the time and the potential problem with negatively pressurizing the building is avoided. Since the supply airflow rate through the heat exchanger core is purposely reduced to control frost formation, average volumetric airflow rates below 50% of nominal are allowed when this frost control is active and no warning message is issued.</p>
<p>The user enters a threshold temperature, an initial defrost time fraction, and a rate of defrost time fraction increase. When the temperature of the supply air (e.g., outdoor air) entering the heat exchanger is equal to or below the specified threshold temperature, the fractional amount of time that the supply air is bypassed around the heat exchanger core is determined from the following equation:</p>
<div>\[{X_{DefrostTime}} = {X_{Initial}} + {X_{RateofIncrease}}({T_{Threshold}} - {T_{SupAirIn}})\]</div>

<p>where:</p>
<div img="image5515.txt">\({X_{DefrostTime}}\)</div>

<p>= Fractional time period for frost control <div img="image5516.txt">(\left( {0\,\, \le \,\,\,{X_{DefrostTime}}\,\, \le \,\,1} \right))</div></p>
<div img="image5517.txt">\({X_{Initial}}\)</div>

<p>= Initial defrost time fraction</p>
<div img="image5518.txt">\({X_{RateofIncrease}}\)</div>

<p>= Rate of defrost time fraction increase (K<sup>-1</sup>)</p>
<div img="image5519.txt">\({T_{Threshold}}\)</div>

<p>= Threshold temperature (°C)</p>
<div img="image5520.txt">\({T_{SupAirIn}}\)</div>

<p>= Supply air inlet temperature (°C)</p>
<p>During the defrost time, supply air flow is fully bypassed around the heat exchanger core and no heat transfer takes place. For the remainder of the time period, no air is bypassed and full heat exchange is achieved. The average supply air flow bypassed around the heat exchanger core is calculated as follows:</p>
<div>\[{\mathop m\limits^ \bullet_{_{SupAirBypass}}} = ({X_{DefrostTime}}){\mathop m\limits^ \bullet_{_{SupAir}}}\]</div>

<p>To determine the average heat transfer rates for the simulation time step, the supply air outlet conditions are first calculated as if the heat exchanger were not in defrost mode (see previous section, Model Description). The sensible and total heat transfer rates are then calculated and multiplied by the fractional time period that the heat exchanger is not in defrost mode (1-<em>X<sub>DefrostTime</sub></em>).</p>
<div>\[{\mathop Q\limits^ \bullet_{Sensible}} = (1 - {X_{DefrostTime}})\left( {\mathop m\limits^ \bullet  cp,\sup } \right)({T_{SupAirIn}} - {T_{SupAirOut}})\]</div>

<div>\[{\mathop Q\limits^ \bullet_{Total}} = (1 - {X_{DefrostTime}}){\mathop m\limits^ \bullet_{_{SupAir}}}({h_{SupAirIn}} - {h_{SupAirOut}})\]</div>

<p>Once the average heat transfer rates are determined, the average conditions of the supply air exiting the overall heat exchanger unit are calculated as follows:</p>
<div>\[{T_{SupAirOut}} = {T_{SupAirIn\,}}\,\,\, - \,\,\,\frac{{{{\mathop Q\limits^ \bullet  }_{Sensible}}}}{{\mathop m\limits^ \bullet  cp,\sup }}\]</div>

<div>\[{h_{SupAirOut}} = {h_{SupAirIn}}\,\,\, - \,\,\,\frac{{{{\mathop Q\limits^ \bullet  }_{_{Total}}}}}{{{{\mathop m\limits^ \bullet  }_{_{SupAir}}}}}\]</div>

<div>\[{\omega_{SupAirOut}} = PsyWFnTdbH({T_{SupAirOut}},{h_{SupAirOut}})\]</div>

<p>As described previously, if the predicted conditions of the exiting supply air exceed the saturation curve (&gt;100% RH), then the temperature and humidity ratio of the air are reset to saturated conditions (= 100% RH) at the enthalpy condition calculated above (<em>h<sub>SupAirOut</sub>).</em>If the supply air temperature is reset, the average sensible heat transfer rate is recalculated before the exhaust air outlet conditions are determined:</p>
<div>\[{T_{ExhAirOut}} = {T_{ExhAirIn}}\,\,\, + \,\,\,\frac{{{{\mathop Q\limits^ \bullet  }_{Sensible}}}}{{\mathop m\limits^ \bullet  cp,exh}}\]</div>

<div>\[{h_{ExhAirOut}} = {h_{ExhAirIn}}\,\,\,\, + \,\,\,\frac{{{{\mathop Q\limits^ \bullet  }_{_{Total}}}}}{{{{\mathop m\limits^ \bullet  }_{_{ExhAir}}}}}\]</div>

<div>\[{\omega_{ExhAirOut}} = PsyWFnTdbH({T_{ExhAirOut}},{h_{ExhAirOut}})\]</div>

<h4 id="exhaust-air-recirculation">Exhaust Air Recirculation</h4>
<p>This method of frost control routes exhaust (outlet) air back through the supply side of the heat exchanger to warm the core. Since this method routes exhaust air back into the building, the building is typically not depressurized when this frost control is active. However, the incoming supply (outdoor ventilation) air flow is stopped for the fractional period of time that frost control is active. If significant periods of time exist when outdoor temperatures are below the selected threshold temperature and outdoor ventilation air is continuously required, an alternative method of frost control should be considered.</p>
<p>The user enters a threshold temperature, an initial defrost time fraction, and a rate of defrost time fraction increase. When the temperature of the inlet supply air (e.g., outdoor air) is equal to or below the specified threshold temperature, the fractional amount of time that this heat exchanger frost control strategy is active is determined from the following equation:</p>
<div>\[{X_{DefrostTime}} = {X_{Initial}} + {X_{RateofIncrease}}({T_{Threshold}} - {T_{SupAirIn}})\]</div>

<p>The air mass flow rate of the supply air leaving the heat exchanger unit is then calculated using the defrost time fraction calculated above the mass flow rates of supply and exhaust air entering the unit.</p>
<div>\[{\mathop m\limits^ \bullet_{_{SupAirOut}}} = (1 - {X_{DefrostTime}}){\mathop m\limits^ \bullet_{_{SupAirIn}}}\,\, + \,\,{X_{DefrostTime}}{\mathop m\limits^ \bullet_{_{ExhAirIn}}}\]</div>

<p>The model assumes that no heat exchange occurs during defrost, and the average supply supply air conditions are simply a blend of the conditions when the unit is not in defrost and the exhaust air inlet conditions during defrost operation:</p>
<div>\[{T_{SupAirOut}} = \,\,\frac{{(1 - {X_{DefrostTime}}){{\mathop m\limits^ \bullet  }_{_{SupAirIn}}}{T_{SupAirOut,NoDefrost\,}} + \,\,{X_{DefrostTime}}{{\mathop m\limits^ \bullet  }_{_{ExhAirIn}}}{T_{ExhAirIn\,}}}}{{{{\mathop m\limits^ \bullet  }_{_{SupAirOut}}}}}\]</div>

<div>\[{\omega_{SupAirOut}} = \,\,\frac{{(1 - {X_{DefrostTime}}){{\mathop m\limits^ \bullet  }_{_{SupAirIn}}}{\omega_{SupAirOut,NoDefrost\,}} + \,\,{X_{DefrostTime}}{{\mathop m\limits^ \bullet  }_{_{ExhAirIn}}}{\omega_{ExhAirIn\,}}}}{{{{\mathop m\limits^ \bullet  }_{_{SupAirOut}}}}}\]</div>

<div>\[{h_{SupAirOut}} = PsyHFnTdbW({T_{SupAirOut}},{\omega_{SupAirOut}})\]</div>

<p>The operating effectivenesses of the heat exchanger are initially calculated according to Equations and assuming no defrost operation. Since the supply air flow across the heat exchanger core is not reduced during defrost operation, the sensible and latent effectiveness are therefore derated (for reporting purposes) in direct proportion to the fraction of time that frost control is not active.</p>
<div>\[{\varepsilon_{operating,sensible}} = (1 - {X_{DefrostTime}}){\varepsilon_{operating,sensible}}\]</div>

<div>\[{\varepsilon_{operating,latent}} = (1 - {X_{DefrostTime}}){\varepsilon_{operating,latent}}\]</div>

<p>Since the exhaust outlet air is recirculated through the supply side of the heat exchanger core, the incoming supply air and exiting exhaust air flows are stopped for the fraction of the time when frost control is active. The average air mass flow rate at the supply air inlet and the exhaust air outlet nodes are therefore reduced accordingly.</p>
<div>\[{\mathop m\limits^ \bullet_{_{SupAirIn}}} = (1 - {X_{DefrostTime}}){\mathop m\limits^ \bullet_{_{SupAirIn}}}\]</div>

<div>\[{\mathop m\limits^ \bullet_{_{ExhAirOut}}} = (1 - {X_{DefrostTime}}){\mathop m\limits^ \bullet_{_{ExhAirOut}}}\]</div>

<p>The conditions of the exiting (outlet) exhaust air (temperature, humidity ratio and enthalpy) are reported as the values when frost control is not active (i.e., the conditions when exhaust air is actually leaving the unit).</p>
<h4 id="minimum-exhaust-temperature">Minimum Exhaust Temperature</h4>
<p>With this frost control method, frost formation is avoided by continuously maintaining the temperature of the exhaust air leaving the heat exchanger core above a specified setpoint. The minimum exhaust air temperature is maintained by modulating heat exchanger rotational speed or by bypassing supply air around a plate heat exchanger. For this frost control method, the user must only enter the threshold (minimum) temperature.</p>
<p>For the case of modulating heat exchanger rotation, the operating effectivenesses and outlet air conditions are first calculated as if the heat exchanger is not in defrost mode (see Model Description). If the resulting temperature of the exhaust air leaving the heat exchanger core is below the specified threshold temperature, then the operating effectivenesses are reduced as follows:</p>
<div>\[{X_{DefrostTime}} = \frac{{({T_{Threshold}} - {T_{ExhAirOut}})}}{{({T_{ExhAirIn}} - {T_{ExhAirOut}})}}\]</div>

<div>\[{\varepsilon_{operating,sensible}} = (1 - {X_{DefrostTime}}){\varepsilon_{operating,sensible}}\]</div>

<div>\[{\varepsilon_{operating,latent}} = (1 - {X_{DefrostTime}}){\varepsilon_{operating,latent}}\]</div>

<p>The supply air and exhaust air outlet conditions are then recalculated using these reduced effectiveness values. Finally the sensible, latent and total heat recovery rates are calculated along with the unit’s electric power and electric consumption.</p>
<p>The calculation procedure is slightly different for the case of a plate heat exchanger where the supply air is bypassed around the heat exchanger core. Since the volumetric air flow rate through the heat exchanger core is reduced when frost control is active, an iterative process is used to determine the operating effectiveness of the heat exchanger. The operating effectivenesses and outlet air conditions are first calculated as if the heat exchanger is not in defrost mode (see Model Description). If the resulting temperature of the exhaust air leaving the heat exchanger core is below the specified threshold temperature, then the fractional defrost time is calculated as follows:</p>
<div>\[{X_{DefrostTime}} = \frac{{({T_{Threshold}} - {T_{ExhAirOut}})}}{{({T_{ExhAirIn}} - {T_{ExhAirOut}})}}\]</div>

<p>The iteration process then begins to determine the heat exchanger effectiveness and the exhaust air outlet temperature as if frost control were active. The operating mass flow rate through the supply side of the heat exchanger core is calculated.</p>
<p><em>Beginning of iteration process:</em></p>
<div>\[{\mathop m\limits^ \bullet_{_{SupAirCore}}} = (1 - {X_{DefrostTime}}){\mathop m\limits^ \bullet_{_{SupAirIn}}}\]</div>

<div>\[{\mathop m\limits^ \bullet_{_{SupAirBypass}}} = ({X_{DefrostTime}}){\mathop m\limits^ \bullet_{_{SupAirIn}}}\]</div>

<p>The ratio of average volumetric flow rate through the heat exchanger core to heat exchanger’s nominal volumetric flow rate (<em>HX<sub>flowratio</sub></em>) is then determined and used to calculate the operating effectiveness of the heat exchanger using Equations and . Since the supply airflow rate through the heat exchanger core is purposely reduced to control frost formation, average volumetric airflow rates below 50% of nominal are allowed and no warning message is issued. Supply air outlet temperature (leaving the heat exchanger core), sensible heat transfer, and exhaust air outlet temperature are then calculated using the revised heat exchanger effectiveness.</p>
<div>\[{T_{SupAirOut}} = {T_{SupAirIn}} + {\varepsilon_{operating,sensible}}\left( {\frac{{\mathop m\limits^ \bullet  cp,\min }}{{\mathop m\limits^ \bullet  cp,\sup }}} \right)({T_{ExhAirIn}} - {T_{SupAirIn}})\]</div>

<div>\[{\mathop Q\limits^ \bullet_{Sensible}} = (1 - {X_{DefrostTime}})\left( {\mathop m\limits^ \bullet  cp,\sup } \right)({T_{SupAirInlet}} - {T_{SupAirOutlet}})\]</div>

<div>\[{T_{ExhAirOut}} = {T_{ExhAirIn}} + \frac{{{{\mathop Q\limits^ \bullet  }_{Sensible}}}}{{\mathop m\limits^ \bullet  cp,exh}}\]</div>

<p>The error between the exhaust outlet temperature and the threshold temperature for frost control and a new defrost time fraction are subsequently calculated.</p>
<div>\[Error = {T_{ExhAirOut}} - {T_{Threshold}}\]</div>

<div>\[{X_{DefrostTime}} = \,{X_{DefrostTime}}\,\left( {\frac{{{T_{ExhAirIn}} - {T_{ExhAirOut}}}}{{{T_{ExhAirIn}} - {T_{Threshold}}}}} \right)\]</div>

<p><em>End of iteration process:</em></p>
<p>The iteration process ends when the calculated error is within an error tolerance of 0.001.  The air streams passing through the heat exchanger core and bypassing the core through the bypass damper are then blended together to provide the air conditions leaving the heat exchanger unit. Finally the sensible, latent and total heat recovery rates are calculated along with the unit’s electric power and electric consumption.</p>
<h4 id="economizer-operation">Economizer Operation</h4>
<p>A conventional air-side economizer may be used in conjunction with this heat exchanger object. The air-side economizer is specified through the use of an outside air controller (see object: Controller:OutdoorAir). Specify the appropriate economizer control type, and provide the required control points and air flow rates as defined in the outside air controller object. Energy transfer provided by the heat exchanger will be suspended whenever free cooling is available (i.e., when the air-side economizer is activated) and <em>the user specified economizer lockout input is specified as Yes</em>. For plate heat exchangers, heat transfer is suspended by fully bypassing the supply and exhaust air around the heat exchanger core. For rotary heat exchangers, air flows continue through the core but it is assumed that heat exchanger rotation is stopped.</p>
<p>Heat exchange can also be suspended for the purposes of providing free cooling operation in the absence of a conventional air-side economizer. In this case specify “MinimumFlowWithBypass” as the economizer choice and again provide the required control points as defined in the outside air controller object. Energy transfer provided by the heat exchanger will be suspended whenever free cooling is available and <em>the user specified economizer lockout input is specified as Yes</em>, however the supply air flow rate will remain at the minimum value specified in the outside air controller object. Note that the Economizer Type must be set to something other than NoEconomizer for this control interaction to function.</p>
<p>If economizer operation is not required, specify “NoEconomizer” as the economizer control type in the outside air controller object. The heat exchanger will operate according to its availability schedule and free cooling will not be provided. . If economizer operation <em>is</em> required and the heat exchanger <em>should not</em> provide free cooling, specify the input for the heat exchanger’s economizer lockout as No and heat recovery will remain active during economizer mode.</p>
<p>Heat recovery for this heat exchanger may also be suspended during a high humidity control event (see object Controller:OutdoorAir) in a similar manner. Specifying Yes for economizer lockout will also suspend heat recovery when high humidity control is activated. The default value for economizer lockout is Yes and must be specifically entered as No to disable the economizer or high humidity control lockout feature.</p>
<h4 id="supply-air-outlet-temperature-control">Supply Air Outlet Temperature Control</h4>
<p>This heat exchanger object can also control the supply air outlet temperature to a setpoint to avoid overheating. This temperature control is accomplished through wheel speed modulation or bypassing supply air around the heat exchanger. To model this temperature control, the user must specify ‘Yes’ for the Supply Air Outlet Temperature Control field in this heat exchanger object, and a separate setpoint manager (see object: SetpointManager:Scheduled) and temperature schedule  must be specified for the heat exchanger unit’s supply air outlet node.</p>
<p>This control strategy is typically used in conjunction with economizer operation (see object Controller:OutdoorAir), and an example control profile is shown in the figure below. When the outdoor air temperature falls to the specified maximum limit for economizer operation, heat exchange is suspended (air is fully bypassed around the heat exchanger core or heat exchanger rotation is stopped). The figure below shows economizer operation being initiated based on outdoor temperature but other triggers can be used (e.g. differential temperature [outdoor temperature with respect to exhaust air temperature], single point enthalpy or differential enthalpy). Heat exchange remains suspended until the outdoor temperature falls to the minimum temperature (temperature lower limit) for economizer control. The setpoint for the supply air outlet temperature control should match the economizer temperature lower limit.</p>
<p>As the outdoor air temperature falls further below the setpoint for the supply air outlet temperature (same as the economizer lower temperature limit), the heat exchanger bypass dampers will modulate closed to maintain the desired supply air temperature for a plate heat exchanger. For a rotary heat exchanger the rotary heat exchanger speed will gradually increase to maintain the desired supply air temperature. Modulation of heat exchanger performance will continue until the supply air temperature setpoint can no longer be maintained. This control is only active if the entering supply (primary) air temperature is less thatn the heat exchanger setpoint temperature.</p>

<h4 id="overview_15">Overview</h4>
<p>The input object HeatExchanger:AirToAir:FlatPlate provides an NTU – effectiveness model of a static flat plate air-to-air heat exchanger. Humidity issues are ignored in this model. A full, detailed description of the model can be found in the reference.</p>
<p>The inputs for the model are the design values for the primary air flow rate, primary air inlet and outlet temperature,  secondary air flow rate, and secondary air inlet temperature. No design UAs are required: instead, the ratio (at design conditions) of the primary <em>hA</em> to the secondary <em>hA</em> (<em>r<sub>hA</sub></em>) is input. The flow configuration is also an input (counter, parallel, or crossflow).</p>
<p>n An important feature of this model is that the heat exchanger total <em>UA</em> is a time varying function of the primary and secondary mass flow rates and inlet temperatures.</p>

From the <em>UA</em> and the capacity flow ratio the <em>NTU</em> is determined: <div img="image5553.txt">(NTU = UA/{C_{\min }})</div>.

<h4 id="economizer-operation_1">Economizer Operation</h4>
<p>A conventional air-side economizer may be used in conjunction with this heat exchanger object. The air-side economizer is specified through the use of an outside air controller (see object: Controller:OutdoorAir). Specify the appropriate economizer control type, and provide the required control points and air flow rates as defined in the outside air controller object. Energy transfer provided by the heat exchanger will be suspended whenever free cooling is available (i.e., when the air-side economizer is activated) or high humidity control is active and <em>the user specified economizer lockout input is specified as Yes</em>. For this flat plate heat exchanger, heat transfer is suspended by fully bypassing the supply and exhaust air around the heat exchanger core. If the economizer lockout is specified as No, the flat plate heat exchanger is operational even when economizer or high humidity mode is active. The default value for economizer lockout is Yes and must be specifically entered as No to disable the economizer or high humidity control lockout feature.</p>

<h4 id="overview_16">Overview</h4>
<p>The input object HeatExchanger:Desiccant:BalancedFlow provides a model for a desiccant heat exchanger that is an HVAC component used to model both temperature (sensible) and moisture (latent) heat exchange between two air streams (Figure 252). The model assumes balanced air flow through the regeneration and process sides of the heat exchanger (i.e., regeneration and process air volume flow rates and face velocities are the same). Heat exchanger performance is specified through a performance data type object (e.g., Heat Exchanger:Desiccant:BalancedFlow:Performance Data Type 1). Refer to the EnergyPlus Input Output Reference for the specific input syntax for this desiccant heat exchanger object.</p>

<p>EnergyPlus has another air-to-air heat exchanger object for modeling sensible and latent heat transfer between two air streams that uses the input object HeatExchanger:AirToAir:SensibleAndLatent. That heat exchanger model uses effectiveness values specified by the user to determine exiting air conditions from each side of the heat exchanger. In contrast, the balanced flow desiccant heat exchanger references a performance data type object (e.g., HeatExchanger:Desiccant:BalancedFlow:PerformanceDataType1) which defines the model equations, user-specified model coefficients, and min/max limits for the model’s independent and dependent variables.</p>
<h4 id="model-description_11">Model Description</h4>
<p>This heat exchanger is a simple object that performs three basic functions:</p>
<p>1.    Informs the associated performance data type object (e.g., HeatExchanger:Desiccant:BalancedFlow:PerformanceDataType1) if it should calculate heat exchange for a simulation time step, or if heat exchange is suspended for the time step (i.e., bypass air flow around a fixed-plate heat exchanger or stop the rotation of a rotary heat exchanger),</p>
<p>2.    Passes the process and regeneration air inlet conditions (e.g., dry-bulb temperature, humidity ratio, air mass flow rate) to the associated performance data type object, and</p>
<p>3.    Reports the total, sensible and latent cooling/heating rates and electric power based on the results from the performance data type model that is specified.</p>
<p>While the desiccant heat exchanger object’s availability to provide heat exchange between the two air streams is determined by the user-specified availability schedule, other objects that call this heat exchanger object can also control its heat exchange during a simulation time step. Currently, this desiccant heat exchanger model can be referenced by two compound objects: CoilSystem:Cooling:DX:HeatExchangerAssisted and Dehumidifier:Desiccant:System, both of which are used to provide enhanced dehumidification over conventional systems. If this heat exchanger is referenced by a compound object, the compound object will control heat exchanger operation (i.e., tell the heat exchanger if heat exchange is needed or not for each simulation time step). Details for how the compound objects control exchanger operation are described elsewhere in this document (ref. CoilSystem:Cooling:DX:HeatExchangerAssisted and Dehumidifier:Desiccant:System).</p>
<p>This desiccant heat exchanger object may also be specified directly in a AirLoopVHAC (air loop BranchList) or in an AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem:EquipmentList without being referenced by a compound object. If specified directly in a AirLoopHVAC loop or AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem:EquipmentList, then the heat exchanger can be controlled to provide heat exchange based on a maximum and/or minimum humidity setpoint placed on the process air outlet node (ref. SetpointManagers). If no humidity setpoints are provided on this node, then heat exchange will be provided whenever the heat exchanger is available to operate (via its availability schedule) and there is a temperature and/or humidity ratio difference between the two air streams. Further details regarding heat exchanger control via humidity setpoints on the process air outlet node are described in the section for the associated data type object (e.g., HeatExchanger:Desiccant:BalancedFlow:PerformanceDataType1).</p>
<p>The balanced flow desiccant heat exchanger model first checks for three conditions to be true before calling the specified performance data type model to calculate heat exchanger performance:</p>
<p>·        Non-zero air mass flow rates on the process and regeneration inlet air nodes,</p>
<p>·        Desiccant heat exchanger is available to operate based on its availability schedule,</p>
<p>·        If a compound object is calling this desiccant heat exchanger, it is requesting that heat exchange be provided.</p>
<p>If any of these conditions is false, then heat exchange is suspended and the model simply passes the air conditions on the process and regeneration air inlet nodes to the respective outlet air nodes. In addition, the heat exchanger electric power is set to zero.</p>
<p>If all of the above conditions are true, then heat exchange is active and the specified performance data type model is called to calculate the process and regeneration outlet air conditions and heat exchanger electric power. Immediately before this call to the performance data type model, a check is made to determine if the operating air flow rates through the heat exchanger (i.e., the actual air flow rates for the simulation time step) are equal (balanced flow). If a difference of more than 2% exists between the process and regeneration air flow rates at any time during the simulation, a warning is issued.</p>
<p>After the specified performance data type model calculates the process/regeneration air outlet conditions and heat exchanger electric power, the balanced flow desiccant heat exchanger model uses that information to report overall performance. Specifically, the heat exchanger’s sensible, latent and total heating and cooling rates are calculated for the process air side of the heat exchanger. Since energy must be conserved, the same heating or cooling rates apply to the regeneration air stream although they are opposite in heat transfer direction (e.g., a sensible cooling rate on the process air side of the heat exchanger would indicate an equivalent sensible heating rate on the regeneration air side).</p>
<div>\[{\mathop Q\limits^ \bullet_{Sensible}} = \,{\mathop m\limits^ \bullet_{Proc}}C{p_{Proc,\,\,in}}\left( {{T_{Proc,\,\,out}}\, - \,{T_{Proc,\,\,in}}} \right)\]</div>

<p>To simplify the accounting of heat exchanger performance, the sensible, latent, and total heat transfer rates for the process side of the heat exchanger are stored in cooling and heating report variables. For example, if the sensible heat transfer rate is negative, the absolute value is stored in a “cooling” rate report variable. Conversely, if the sensible heat transfer rate is positive, the value is stored in a “heating” rate report variable. Similar accounting is performed for the latent and total heat transfer rate variables as follows:</p>
<div>\[IF\left( {{{\mathop Q\limits^ \bullet  }_{Sensible}} <  = 0} \right){\mathop Q\limits^ \bullet_{SensibleCooling}} = ABS\left( {{{\mathop Q\limits^ \bullet  }_{Sensible}}} \right)\]</div>

<div>\[IF\left( {{{\mathop Q\limits^ \bullet  }_{Sensible}} > 0} \right){\mathop Q\limits^ \bullet_{SensibleHeating}} = {\mathop Q\limits^ \bullet_{Sensible}}\]</div>

<div>\[IF\left( {{{\mathop Q\limits^ \bullet  }_{Latent}} > 0} \right){\mathop Q\limits^ \bullet_{LatentHeating}} = {\mathop Q\limits^ \bullet_{Latent}}\]</div>

<div>\[IF\left( {{{\mathop Q\limits^ \bullet  }_{Total}} > 0} \right){\mathop Q\limits^ \bullet_{TotalHeating}} = {\mathop Q\limits^ \bullet_{Total}}\]</div>

<p>At the end of each HVAC simulation time step, this object reports the sensible, latent and total cooling/heating energy and electric consumption for the heat exchanger as follows:</p>

<p>A conventional air-side economizer may be used in conjunction with this heat exchanger object. The air-side economizer is specified through the use of an outside air controller (see object: Controller:OutdoorAir). Specify the appropriate economizer control type, and provide the required control points and air flow rates as defined in the outside air controller object. Energy transfer provided by the heat exchanger will be suspended whenever free cooling is available (i.e., when the air-side economizer is activated) or high humidity control is active and <em>the user specified economizer lockout input is specified as Yes</em>. For the desiccant heat exchanger, heat transfer is assumed to be provided by a rotating heat exchanger core. For this reason, air continues to flow through the core when the outdoor air economizer is active but it is assumed that the rotation of the heat exchanger core is stopped. If the economizer lockout is specified as No, the desiccant heat exchanger is operational even when economizer or high humidity mode is active. This specific type of heat exchanger is typically <em>not</em> controlled by an outdoor air economizer. For this reason, the default value for economizer lockout is No and must be specifically entered as Yes to enable the economizer or high humidity control lockout feature.</p>
<h4 id="desiccant-heat-exchanger-performance-data">Desiccant Heat Exchanger Performance Data</h4>
<h5 id="overview_17">Overview</h5>
<p>The input object HeatExchanger:Desiccant:BalancedFlow:PerformanceDataType1 specifies a performance model and model coefficients for a balanced flow desiccant heat exchanger. The HeatExchanger:Desiccant:BalancedFlow:PerformanceDataType1 object is referenced by a HeatExchanger:Desiccant:BalancedFlow object. This performance data object is used to specify the thermal performance and electric consumption of the heat exchanger. Some representative inputs for this object are provided in the EnergyPlus Reference DataSets (PerfCurves.idf).</p>
<p>This model predicts the regeneration air stream outlet temperature and humidity ratio values based on the entering regeneration and process air stream temperature, humidity ratio and face velocity. The process air stream outlet humidity ratio and temperatures are calculated based on a simple heat and moisture balance. The model requires that the user enter the nominal volumetric flow rate and a nominal face velocity, electric power consumption, empirical model coefficients for the regeneration outlet air temperature and humidity ratio equations, and the applicable minimum and maximum values for both the independent and dependent variables for the empirical model coefficients provided. Refer to the EnergyPlus Input Output Reference for details regarding the input syntax for this object.</p>
<h5 id="heat-exchanger-face-area-and-air-velocity">Heat Exchanger Face Area and Air Velocity</h5>
<p>The user is required to enter a nominal volumetric air flow rate and a nominal face velocity. From these inputs, a heat exchanger face area (applicable for both the regeneration and process sides of the heat exchanger) is calculated and used to determine the operating face velocity during the simulation.</p>

<p>The face velocity calculated each simulation time step is used in the empirical equations (see ‘Model Calculations’ below) and should be within the minimum and maximum velocity boundaries specified for the model coefficients (see ‘Empirical Model Boundaries (Minimum and Maximum)‘ below). When the calculated air velocity exceeds one of the boundaries, a warning is issued and the velocity is reset to the appropriate boundary value before being passed to the empirical equations for calculating regeneration air outlet temperature and humidity ratio. If the user is confident in their empirical model coefficients, the minimum and maximum velocity boundaries may be expanded slightly (caution should be used here) to allow extrapolation of the empirical equations during the simulation.</p>
<h5 id="model-calculations">Model Calculations</h5>
<p>The model coefficients may be obtained by curve fitting field measurements or the results from other computer models that accurately reflect the performance of a balanced flow desiccant heat exchanger. A wide range of data is necessary to properly define the performance of the desiccant heat exchanger such that all operating conditions expected during a simulation are included in the range of data used to obtain the model coefficients. The minimum and maximum boundaries for the independent variables used to generate the empirical model coefficients are used by this model to ensure that model extrapolation does not occur at any point during the simulation. For this reason, it is recommended that the widest possible range of data be used to determine the model coefficients.</p>
<p>The dry-bulb temperature of the regeneration outlet air is determined using the equation shown below.</p>
<div>\[RTO = B1 + B2*RWI + B3*RTI + B4*\left( {\frac{{RWI}}{{RTI}}} \right) + B5*PWI + B6*PTI + B7*\left( {\frac{{PWI}}{{PTI}}} \right) + B8*RFV\]</div>

<p>Similarly, the humidity ratio of the regeneration outlet air is defined using the same empirical equation form; however, different coefficients are used as follows:</p>
<div>\[RWO = C1 + C2*RWI + C3*RTI + C4*\left( {\frac{{RWI}}{{RTI}}} \right) + C5*PWI + C6*PTI + C7*\left( {\frac{{PWI}}{{PTI}}} \right) + C8*RFV\]</div>

<p>where:</p>
<div img="image5616.txt">\(RWO\)</div>

<p>= regeneration outlet air humidity ratio (kg/kg)</p>
<p>If the regeneration outlet air conditions exceed the saturation curve, RTO and RWO are reset to saturated conditions (100% RH) at the enthalpy calculated based on the original RTO and RWO values.</p>
<p>Once the regeneration outlet air conditions are determined as described above, the dry-bulb temperature and humidity ratio differences across the regeneration side of the heat exchanger are calculated.</p>
<div>\[{T_{diff}} = \,RTO - {T_{Reg,\,\,in}}\]</div>

<p>The regeneration outlet air conditions described above represent the full load outlet conditions under steady-state operation. However, there are times when the heat exchanger may not operate for the entire simulation time step (i.e., bypass air flow around a fixed-plate heat exchanger or stop the rotation of a rotary heat exchanger for a portion of the time step). For example, the parent object calling this heat exchanger model may request that it only provide heat exchange for a portion of the time step (<em>HXPartLoadRatio</em>). Another example would be if this heat exchanger is not called by a parent object but is instead placed directly in a AirLoopHVAC or AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem and a setpoint manager is used to place a minimum and/or maximum humidity ratio setpoint on the process air outlet node. For this case the humidity setpoints, if present, are used to calculate a part-load ratio for the heat exchanger assuming the full-load process air humidity ratio difference is equivalent (but opposite in sign) to the regeneration air humidity ratio difference (<em>w<sub>diff</sub></em>):</p>
<div img="image5623.txt">\(\begin{array}{l}IF\,\,\left( {{w_{diff}} > 0.0} \right)\,\,THEN\,\,!\,\,Regen\,\,air\,humidified,\,process\,air\,dehumidified\\\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,HXPartLoadRatio = \,\frac{{\left( {{w_{Proc,\,\,in}} - {w_{max, set\,point}}} \right)}}{{{w_{diff}}}}\\ELSE\,IF\,\left( {{w_{diff}} < 0.0} \right)\,\,THEN\,\,!\,\,Regen\,\,air\,dehumidified,\,process\,air\,humidified\\\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,HXPartLoadRatio = \,\frac{{\left( {{w_{Proc,\,\,in}} - {w_{min, set\,point}}} \right)}}{{{w_{diff}}}}\\END\,IF\\HXPartLoadRatio = MAX\left( {0.0,HXPartLoadRatio} \right)\\HXPartLoadRatio = MIN\,\left( {1.0,HXPartLoadRatio} \right)\end{array}\)</div>

<p>If this heat exchanger is not being called by a parent object and no humidity setpoints are placed on the process air outlet node, then the model assumes that the heat exchanger operates for the entire simulation time step when it is available to operate (based on its availability schedule) and there is a temperature and/or humidity ratio difference between the two air streams.</p>
<p>EnergyPlus has an established convention for placing information on outlet air nodes. If the air flow rate is continuous but the device only operates for a portion of the simulation time step, then the average outlet conditions (temperature, humidity and enthalpy) are placed on the outlet air node. If the air flow rate cycles on and off during the simulation time step, then the full load outlet conditions are placed on the outlet air node along with the average air mass flow rate for the simulation time step. To account for these cases, this model uses the following logic:</p>
<div>\[\begin{array}{l}IF(FanOpMode\,\,.EQ.\,\,CycFanCycComp\,\,.OR.\,\,RegAirInletIsOANode)\,THEN\\\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,{T_{Reg,\,\,out}}\, = \,{T_{Reg,\,\,in}} + {T_{diff}}\\\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,{w_{Reg,\,\,out}}\, = \,{w_{Reg,\,\,in}} + {w_{diff}}\\ELSE\\\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,{T_{Reg,\,\,out}}\, = \,{T_{Reg,\,\,in}} + \left( {{T_{diff}}*HXPartLoadRatio} \right)\\\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,{w_{Reg,\,\,out}}\, = \,{w_{Reg,\,\,in}} + \left( {{w_{diff}}*HXPartLoadRatio} \right)\\ENDIF\end{array}\]</div>

<p>where:</p>

<div img="image5626.txt">\({w_{Reg,\,\,out}}\)</div>

<p>= regeneration outlet air humidity ratio (kg/kg)</p>
<div img="image5627.txt">\(HXPartLoadRatio\)</div>

<p>= heat exchanger part-load ratio (determined by parent object calling this model, or calculated based on a minimum/maximum humidity ratio setpoints as shown above).</p>
<p>In the logic shown above, <em>RegAirInletIsOANode</em> is true if the regeneration air inlet node is an outside air node. If so, the model assumes that the air flow through the regeneration side of the heat exchanger cycles on and off as required during the simulation time step. Also, the regeneration outlet air humidity ratio is limited to be between 1E-5 and 1.0.</p>
<p>The regeneration outlet air enthalpy is then calculated using the regeneration outlet air temperature and humidity ratio.</p>

<p>Heat recovery electric power is the electric consumption rate of the unit in watts. The nominal electric power for the heat exchanger is specified in the input data file, and can be used to model controls (transformers, relays, etc.) and/or a motor for a rotary heat exchanger. The model assumes that this electric power is consumed whenever the heat exchanger operates. The electric power is assumed to be zero for all other times. None of this electric power is assumed to contribute thermal load to either of the heat exchanger air streams. As with the thermal performance of the heat exchanger, the power used by the heat exchanger is also proportional to the heat exchanger part load ratio.</p>

<h5 id="empirical-model-boundaries-minimum-and-maximum">Empirical Model Boundaries (Minimum and Maximum)</h5>
<p>Since this model uses empirical equations and extrapolation can cause unexpected results, the entering air conditions to both the regeneration and process sides of the heat exchanger are checked during each simulation time step to make sure they are within the valid range defined by the user. If any of the independent variables used in the equations for RTO and RWO above are outside the minimum and maximum limits specified for each independent variable, the values for these specific independent variables are limited to the appropriate boundary (min/max) value for use by the empirical equations and a warning is issued.</p>
<p>Additional model checks occur by testing the regeneration and process inlet air relative humidities. In this case, the process and regeneration inlet air relative humidities are calculated and compared to the minimum/maximum values specified by the user. If the calculated relative humidity exceeds the specified range at any point during the simulation when the heat exchanger is operating, a warning message is issued but the simulation proceeds.</p>
<p>If the user is confident in their empirical model coefficients, the minimum and maximum independent variable boundaries may be expanded (caution should be used here) to allow extrapolation of the empirical equations during the simulation.</p>
<p>In addition to checking the inlet air conditions, the model allows the user to specify limits for the regeneration air outlet conditions (RTO and RWO). If the calculated value for RTO or RWO exceeds the minimum/maximum limits specified by the user, then the calculated value is reset to the appropriate boundary (min/max) value and a warning message is issued.</p>
<p>This model also assumes that the performance of the desiccant heat exchanger (i.e., the output of the empirical equations) conforms to the following two guidelines.</p>
<p>1.    The regeneration outlet air temperature (RTO) is always less than or equal to the regeneration inlet air temperature (<em>T<sub>RegIn</sub></em>)</p>
<p>2.    The regeneration outlet air humidity ratio (RWO) is always greater than or equal to the regeneration inlet air humidity ratio (<em>w<sub>RegIn</sub></em>)</p>
<p>When the calculated regeneration outlet air conditions do not follow these guidelines, a warning is issued and the simulation proceeds.</p>

<p>This model (Object: GroundHeatExchanger:Vertical) documentation is derived from the M.S. thesis of Arunachalam Murugappan, which is available on the Oklahoma State University web site <a href="http://www.hvac.okstate.edu/">http://www.hvac.okstate.edu/</a>.  Eskilson (1987) Yavuzturk and Spitler (1999) developed the long and short time response factors respectively, which are used in determining the borehole temperature responses. Response factors are infinite series of numbers, which relate the current value of a variable to past values of other variables at discrete time intervals.  These response factors are referred as <em>g</em>-functions. The variable time-step model presented here uses both long time-step <em>g</em>-functions and short time-step <em>g</em>-functions to predict the boreholes response to short term fluctuations in the load.</p>
<h4 id="long-time-step-response-factors">Long Time-Step Response Factors</h4>
<p>Eskilson developed <em>g</em>-functions for various borehole configurations. He plotted the g function curves for different sets of borehole spacing to borehole length ratio <div img="image5647.txt">(B/H)</div> typically for .05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.3 and ∞ (∞ represents the single borehole configuration. All the plots were for the ratio of 0.0005 between the borehole radius and the borehole length <div img="image5648.txt">({r_b}/H)</div>. For any other radius a simple relation between the two radii as given by Eskilson (1987) can be used. Eskilson gives the <em>g</em>-function curves for 38 different configurations.</p>
<p>Figure 253 shows the <em>g</em>-function plotted against the non-dimensional time defined as <div img="image5649.txt">(\ln (t/{t_s}))</div>, <div img="image5650.txt">({t_s} = {H^2}/9\alpha )</div> for various configurations of vertical boreholes with <em>B/H</em> ratio of .1 along with single borehole. It is seen from this figure that the thermal interaction between boreholes increases with time and with the number of boreholes in field.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../EngineeringReference/media/image5651.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 253.  Short Time Step g Function Curve as an Extension of Long Time Step g Function Curves for Different Configuration of Boreholes (Eskilson 1987, Yavuzturk 1999).</p>
<p>The <em>g</em>-functions developed by Eskilson are valid only after time estimated by Eskilson as <div img="image5652.txt">(5r_b^2/\alpha )</div>. This time varies from 3-6 hours for a typical borehole field. This is because the analytical line source model, based on which the Eskilson’s model was developed, does not give a prompt increase in borehole wall temperature at <div img="image5653.txt">(r = {r_b})</div>. It gives acceptable results only after the non-dimensional times of <div img="image5654.txt">(\alpha t/r_b^2 &gt; 5)</div>. But to model short time responses of a borehole we need response factors, which can give accurate results down to minutes.</p>
<h4 id="short-time-step-response-factors">Short Time-Step Response Factors</h4>
<p>Yavuzturk and Spitler (1999) developed short time step response factors using a transient, two-dimensional, implicit finite volume model on a polar grid.</p>
<p>The circular u-tube pipe in the ground loop heat exchanger was approximated as a pie sector of equivalent perimeter.  A constant heat flux for the heat transfer form/to U-tube, a zero heat flux in the angular direction and a constant far field temperature in the radial axis makes up the three boundary condition and undisturbed far field temperature as the initial condition. The numerical model accounts for the thermal resistance due to individual borehole elements; such as resistance of the pipe and grout material and the convection resistance due to the heat transfer fluid in the pipes. The long time step <em>g</em>-functions discussed in the previous section do not account for such effects.</p>
<p>The short time-step <em>g</em>-functions are the same for different borehole configurations. This is because there is no thermal interaction between the boreholes for times less than 200 hrs during which the short time-step <em>g</em>-functions apply. So it is suggested to use the short time-step <em>g</em> function for time steps in the range of 2.5 min and 200 hours and the long time-step <em>g</em>-functions for time steps longer than 200 hours. The <em>g</em> function for any time can be found by linear interpolation between the bounding known values.</p>
<h4 id="development-of-the-variable-short-time-step-model">Development of the Variable Short Time Step Model</h4>
<p>The variable time step model was developed as an extension of the model presented by Yavuzturk and Spitler (1999). The variable, short time step model uses a similar algorithm and extends it to accommodate sub-hourly responses, variable time steps and explicit equations to calculate the outlet fluid temperature of the ground loop heat exchanger.</p>
<p>The uniform time-steps model developed by Yavuzturk and Spitler (1999) is able to pre-calculate all the g-functions at the beginning of the simulation. The variable time-step model on the other hand must calculate the <em>g</em>-functions when the borehole response calculation for each time step is carried out. For every time step a different set of <em>g</em>-functions is needed in the variable time step model as the time at which the <em>g</em>-function is to be applied for the past loads changes for each time-steps.</p>
<p>This is made clear from the illustration in Figure 254, which shows a simulation in progress. The boxes with numbers represent the sub-hourly loads. The time (in hrs) at which these loads occurred are shown by solid arrows above the respective load boxes. The right-most solid arrow gives the current simulation time, which is 3.31 hrs. The times given below the boxes, pointed by dashed arrows, are the time at which the <em>g</em>-functions are to be estimated and applied to the respective sub hourly loads (boxes) for the current time.</p>
<p>For example, let us take the sub hourly loads 1,2 &amp; 3. These loads occurred at 0 hrs, 0.16 hrs &amp; 0.28 hrs. The response of the borehole temperature for the current time step is calculated by applying the <em>g­-</em>functions at 3.15 hrs, 3.03 hrs &amp; 2.5 hrs respectively. Thus to calculate the present borehole temperature, the sub hourly loads 1-12 are superposed using the corresponding <em>g</em> functions at times given by the dashed lines.  This gives the borehole temperature at hr 3.31. However, for the previous time step, which occurred at 3.15 hrs, the g-functions for the loads 1, 2 &amp; 3 are at 2.99 hrs 2.87 hrs and 2.42 hrs, and the over all response is obtained by superposing the loads 1-11.</p>
<p>Thus for each time step since the time step increments are not uniform we need to store the simulation times at which these time-steps occurred, and calculate corresponding <em>g</em>-functions at each time-step.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../EngineeringReference/media/image5655.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 254.  Variable Timestep Ground Loop Heat Exchanger Model Schematic Explaining the <em>g</em> Function Estimation.</p>
<p>Yavuzturk model calculates the outlet fluid temperature by iteration beginning with the undisturbed mean temperature of the surrounding ground as an initial guess. This aggravates the time taken by an already computationally intensive algorithm. To circumvent this a set of explicit equations were formulated to estimate the outlet fluid temperature.</p>
<h4 id="description-of-the-load-aggregation-scheme">Description of the Load Aggregation Scheme</h4>
<p>A load aggregation scheme was developed for energy simulation software with variable short time steps down to one minute. A major issue in the development was the calculation of the <em>g</em>-functions.  As discussed previously in the variable time step environments, the time step increments are not uniform. As a result, g-functions cannot e pre-calculated. Figure 255 shows a schematic of the variable time step ground loop heat exchanger model. The figure shows the larger monthly block loads, hourly loads and sub hourly loads and along with the time of occurrence of those loads. The figure also shows the time at which the <em>g</em>-functions are applied to different load blocks.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../EngineeringReference/media/image5656.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 255.  Schematic of Variable Time Step Model <em>g</em> Function Calculation.</p>
<p>To calculate the response of a past load on the borehole temperature we apply the <em>g</em>-function corresponding to the time elapsed since the load was applied. This is easily understood form the schematic. For example, to calculate the response of the aggregated load 1” (at the end of 730hrs.) for the current time step (2193.733hrs) we apply a <em>g</em>-function at 1463.73hrs. The <em>g</em>-function for the same block 1” at the previous time step, which occurred at 2193.25 hrs, would be at 1463.25hrs. From the schematic it is also seen that for the other two aggregated monthly loads 2”, 3” the <em>g</em>-function are applied at 733.73 hrs and 3.73 hrs for the current time-step and at 733.25 hrs and 3.25 hrs respectively for the previous time-step. The same scheme applies to hourly and sub-hourly. Thus to estimate the time at which the past monthly, hourly or sub-hourly loads occur, we might be tempted to store the simulation times at each time step for the entire simulation, storing load times for the whole length of simulation for a multi year simulation with a variable short time step would require a large amount of memory. But little consideration shows that it is not necessary.  Since the monthly and hourly loads occur at equal intervals of time 730hrs and 1hr respectively, the <em>g</em>-functions can be estimated with the current simulation time and the time at which the load block ends, which is a multiple of the monthly duration of the block size. Only the sub-hourly loads require storage of simulation times.</p>
<p>For example from the schematic (Figure 256), for the sub hourly load 1, which occurred at the end of 2193.25 a <em>g</em>-function at .48 hrs has to be applied and for the next load 2 a <em>g</em>-function at 0.34 hrs has to be applied. Since the time intervals are not even for the sub hourly loads, we need to store the time steps at which those loads occurred. These times are required to estimate the time elapsed between the current simulation time and the time at which the sub hourly loads occurred.</p>
<p>Thus, the algorithm keeps track of the sub hourly loads along with their time of occurrence for a user-defined length of time during which the sub hourly calculations are made. The algorithm also estimates the time weighted hourly load from their corresponding sub hourly loads as each hour passes. The sub-hourly loads are time weighted because of the irregular intervals at which the time-step occurs. This is also illustrated in Figure 256. The sub hourly loads 1,2 &amp;3 occur for varying length of time. The load 3 occurs for a longer duration than 1 and 2 in that order. This implies that the load 3 has to be given more weight than 1 and 2. So the sub hourly loads for a particular hour are multiplied by the length of their respective period of occurrence and averaged over the hour. This is further explained by the schematic in Figure 5.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../EngineeringReference/media/image5657.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 256.  Schematic Showing the Calculation of Hourly Load from the Sub Houly Loads.</p>
<p>The bottom text in the boxes represents the magnitude of the sub hourly loads in W/m for each time step. The duration of the occurrence of each time-step for the each block is shown below the respective block. The first hourly load is given by the expression</p>
<div>\[{\overline q_1} = \left[ \begin{array}{l}\left( {8.36 \times .159} \right) + \left( {6.51 \times .339} \right) + \left( {10.3 \times .107} \right)\\ + \left( {6.92 \times .162} \right) + \left( {9.03 \times .181} \right) + \left( {12 \times .05} \right)\end{array} \right] = 7.993W/m\]</div>

<p>Where <div img="image5659.txt">({\overline q_1})</div> = the first hourly load in W/m</p>
<p>The algorithm keeps track of enough of these past hourly loads to calculate the monthly load. As each month or user defined time passes, hourly loads over the entire month or user defined time “blocks” are averaged and stored in arrays for the respective monthly user defined block of time.</p>
<p>The borehole temperature for any time step is computed by superposing the monthly (larger time block loads) hourly and sub-hourly loads for each time step. To understand more clearly consider the schematic in Figure 256 where the borehole temperature at 2193.733 hour is to be estimated. Here the monthly block time is 730 hrs. We have three monthly aggregated load blocks for 730 hrs, 1460 hrs and 2190 hrs and hourly loads from 2191<sup>st</sup> hr to 2193<sup>rd</sup> hour. For the remaining 0.733 hours a sub hourly calculation is done. The three monthly aggregated load blocks when superposed using long time <em>g-</em>functions, yields the borehole temperature at the end of 2190<sup>th</sup> hour. Then the hourly loads from 2191<sup>st</sup> to 2193<sup>rd</sup> hrs are superposed using the corresponding short time step <em>g</em> functions values yielding the borehole temperature at the end of 2193<sup>rd</sup> hour. The sub-hourly variations for the current hour are obtained, by superposing the sub-hourly loads. From the schematic, we see there are two sub-hourly loads, 1 and 2. Thus the borehole temperature at the end of 2193.733 is expressed as:</p>
<div>\[{T_{2193.733}} = {T_{ground}} + \sum\limits_{m = 1}^3 {\left[ {\frac{{{{\overline{\overline q} }_m} - {{\overline{\overline q} }_{m - 1}}}}{{2\pi {k_{ground}}}}g\left( {\frac{{{t_{2193.733}} - {t_{730(m - 1)}}}}{{{t_s}}},\frac{{{r_b}}}{H}} \right)} \right]} \]</div>

<div>\[ + \sum\limits_{n = 2190}^{2193} {\left[ {\frac{{{{\overline q }_n} - {{\overline q }_{n - 1}}}}{{2\pi {\kappa_{ground}}}}g\left( {\frac{{{t_{2193.733}} - {t_{n - 1}}}}{{{t_s}}},\frac{{{r_b}}}{H}} \right)} \right]} \]</div>

<div>\[ + \sum\limits_{p = 2193}^{2193.733} {\left[ {\frac{{{q_p} - {q_{p - 1}}}}{{2\pi {\kappa_{ground}}}}g\left( {\frac{{{t_{2193.733}} - {t_p}}}{{{t_s}}},\frac{{{r_b}}}{H}} \right)} \right]} \]</div>

<p>Where</p>

<p><em>p</em> = array index for sub hourly loads</p>
<p><em>t</em> = time</p>
<p>t<sub>p</sub>  =  the sub hourly time steps over the history period. (here increment is not always unity)</p>
<p>Superposing the temperature responses of monthly (larger) blocks over the shorter, namely the hourly and sub hourly, introduces some error in the borehole temperature calculation at the beginning of every month. Yavuzturk and Spitler suggest a method to reduce the error in borehole temperature prediction by using a minimum hourly history period during which only the short time step superposition is carried out. In our model this idea is extended to sub hourly loads as well. Thus a user specified minimum sub-hourly history period is included along with the minimum hourly history period to model the sub-hourly variations. During this period only sub-hourly and hourly superpositions are made. This guarantees that at any given time step the superposition of temperature responses involves a minimum period of short time responses, which ensures a better estimation of borehole temperature. For example, a minimum hourly history period of 96 hrs and a minimum sub hourly history period of 5 hours would result in only 2 monthly aggregation blocks (1” and 2”). The last monthly aggregation does not occur because neither of the minimum hourly history period of 96 hours or sub-hourly history period of five hrs is met. So an hourly superposition of the load is carried out for the third month until the minimum sub-hourly history period after which sub hourly superposition is carried out. The equation becomes</p>
<div>\[{T_{2193.733}} = {T_{ground}} + \sum\limits_{m = 1}^2 {\left[ {\frac{{{{\overline{\overline q} }_m} - {{\overline{\overline q} }_{m - 1}}}}{{2\pi {k_{ground}}}}g\left( {\frac{{{t_{2193.733}} - {t_{730(m - 1)}}}}{{{t_s}}},\frac{{{r_b}}}{H}} \right)} \right]} \]</div>

<p>Yavuzturk and Spitler have done a detailed analysis on the effect of minimum hourly history period. They found that a minimum hourly history period of 192 hrs for an annual simulation would reduce the running time by 90%.  They also found that for a 20year simulation, the computation time of the aggregated load scheme is just 1% of the non-aggregated load scheme.</p>
<h4 id="summary-of-variable-short-time-step-response-factor-model">Summary of Variable Short Time Step Response Factor Model</h4>
<p>The load aggregation scheme developed in line with the above example is summarized eight steps as follows:</p>
<p>1.    Define monthly load blocks duration (mb) in hrs (generally 730 hrs) and the minimum hourly history period and minimum sub hourly history period.</p>
<p>2.    Read Borehole Geometry Parameters: number of boreholes, borehole length radius thickness of the pipe etc. Read Ground and Fluid thermal properties: Ground conductivity, volumetric specific heat capacity of the ground and heat carrier fluid. Read the short and long time-step <em>g-</em>functions into arrays with their respective non-dimensionalized times.</p>
<p>3.    Start Simulation from p=1 to nts. Here “nts” is the number of time steps that have occurred since the start of simulation. (Note that P in not a count of number of hour elapsed in the simulation)</p>
<p>4.    Compute the hourly loads as each hour passes. This is done by averaging the sub hourly loads during the past hour. The monthly loads are calculated by averaging the hourly loads during that month. This is done by summing the hourly loads during that monthly period and dividing the sum by 730 hours NumMonths(the number of months used in aggregation calculations) is set to the number of months of simulation (current number of aggregated load blocks)</p>
<p>5.    If the simulation time is less than the minimum sub hourly history period the borehole temperature is estimated with no aggregation. Only sub hourly loads are superposed as given by the following equation.</p>
<div>\[{T_{nts}} = {T_{ground}} + \sum\limits_{p = 1}^{nts} {\left[ {\frac{{{q_p} - {q_{p - 1}}}}{{2\pi {\kappa_{ground}}}}g\left( {\frac{{{t_{nts}} - {t_p}}}{{{t_s}}},\frac{{{r_b}}}{H}} \right)} \right]} \]</div>

<p>6.    . If the simulation time is less than sum of minimum hourly history and sub hourly history periods, then decomposed hourly aggregated loads are superposed using their corresponding g function until the sub hourly history required. Then the sub hourly temperature differences are found by superposing the decomposed sub hourly loads with their short time step <em>g</em> functions. Average borehole temperature is found by superposing the hourly and sub hourly temperature differences with the following equation</p>
<div>\[{T_{nts}} = \sum\limits_{n = 1}^{nh - sh} {\left[ {\frac{{{{\overline q }_n} - {{\overline q }_{n - 1}}}}{{2\pi {\kappa_{ground}}}}g\left( {\frac{{{t_{nts}} - {t_{n - 1}}}}{{{t_s}}},\frac{{{r_b}}}{H}} \right)} \right]}  + \sum\limits_{p = nts - sh}^{nts} {\left[ {\frac{{{q_p} - {q_{p - 1}}}}{{2\pi {\kappa_{ground}}}}g\left( {\frac{{{t_{nts}} - {t_p}}}{{{t_s}}},\frac{{{r_b}}}{H}} \right)} \right]} \]</div>

<p>7.    If the simulation time is greater then the sum of a monthly period, sub hourly history and the hourly history period. Then monthly load aggregation is performed. Here if the difference between the simulation time and product of a monthly block period and the current number of monthly blocks is greater than the sum of the minimum hourly history and sub hourly history periods then the average borehole temperature is found by the following equation.</p>
<div>\[{T_{nts}} = {T_{ground}} + \sum\limits_{m = 1}^{calb} {\left[ {\frac{{{{\overline{\overline q} }_m} - {{\overline{\overline q} }_{m - 1}}}}{{2\pi {\kappa_{ground}}}}g\left( {\frac{{{t_{nts}} - {t_{mb[m - 1]}}}}{{{t_s}}},\frac{{{r_b}}}{H}} \right)} \right]} \]</div>

<p>8.    If the difference between the simulation time and product of a monthly block period and the current number of monthly blocks is less than the sum of the minimum hourly history and sub hourly history periods, then NumMonths is set to one month less than the actual number of months of simulation completed. The average borehole temperature is calculated by superposing the long and time step temperature differences using the following equation.</p>
<div>\[{T_{nts}} = {T_{ground}} + \sum\limits_{m = 1}^{calb - 1} {\left[ {\frac{{{{\overline{\overline q} }_m} - {{\overline{\overline q} }_{m - 1}}}}{{2\pi {\kappa_{ground}}}}g\left( {\frac{{{t_{nts}} - {t_{mb[m - 1]}}}}{{{t_s}}},\frac{{{r_b}}}{H}} \right)} \right]} \]</div>

<p>This model reuses much of the same code including the load aggregation and temperature response caluclations which are described above in the GroundHeatExchanger:Vertical model. As a result, that section can also be used as reference material. This model is unique in that it generates it’s own temperature response factor g-functions, rather than relying on the other software or data to generate the g-functions. These are generated based on the work by Xiong et al. 2015.</p>

<h4 id="model-simplifications-for-computational-efficiency">Model Simplifications for Computational Efficiency</h4>
<p>Several simplifications were used to ensure the g-function temperature response factors are computationally efficient. The first simplification is achieved by taking advantage of symmetry. In the <a href="#SlinkyGHX1">Figure</a> below we can see that by taking advantage of symmettry the temperature response for only one quarter of the rings needs be calculated.</p>
<p>The second simplification occurs by realizing that the effect between two rings decreases exponentially as the distance between the rings increases. Near-field rings are defined as rings whose centers are within 2.5m + D distance from the center of ring i as is seen in <a href="#SlinkyGHX1">Figure</a>. Far-field rings are defined as rings whose centers are beyond 10m + D, with middle-field rings occupying the space in between the near-field and far-field rings. Near-field ring temperature response factors are determined as indicated above for horzontal or vertical slinkys. Middle-field rings are considerably simplified – the interaction between ring is approximated as that of two point sources at their centers. Thermal effect of far-field rings are ignored.</p>
<p>The third and final simplification takes advantatge of geometric similarity that ring share. Ring pairs that are geometrically similar do not require recalculation of distances or reponse factors. Thus the calculations for geometrically similar ring pairs can be reused.</p>

<p>The pond model (Object: GroundHeatExchanger:Pond) is a ‘lumped parameter’ model where the pond is represented by a single node with thermal mass. The pond surface temperature is the same as the temperature at this node, i.e. the surface temperature is the same as the bulk temperature. A first order differential equation is solved in the model to calculate the pond temperature at each time step. This type of heat rejecter is modeled as several circuits connected in parallel.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../EngineeringReference/media/image5676.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 257.  Heat Transfer Mechanisms in a Pond (Chiasson 1999)</p>
<p>Rees(2002) implemented the model developed by Chiasson(1999) for the shallow ponds. The model is based on the assumption that thermal gradients in shallow ponds are negligible, especially during times of heat rejection. Using the lumped parameter approach, an overall energy balance for the pond may be devised as</p>
<div>\[q{}_{in} - q{}_{out} = V\rho C{}_p\frac{{dT}}{{dt}}\]</div>

<p>q<sub>fluid                    </sub> = Total heat transfer to/from the heat exchanging fluid flowing in all spools or  coils in the pond</p>
<p>A heat balance is calculated at a single node that represents the pond. Heat transfer takes place by surface convection, long-wave radiation to the sky, absorption of solar energy, ground heat transfer and heat exchange with the fluid. A heat exchanger analogy is used to calculate the heat transfer between the heat transfer fluid and the pond. The differential equation defined by the heat balance is solved using a fourth order Runge-Kutta numerical integration method. The implementation along with the model equations are summarized in the figure below.</p>

<p>This model (Object: GroundHeatExchanger:Surface) is based on the QTF formulation of heat transfer through building elements with embedded heat sources/sinks. The model uses a heat exchanger analogy to relate the inlet fluid temperature to the net heat transfer rate and consequently outlet temperature. The model is entirely passive, i.e. it does not set any flow rates or incorporate any controls. In order to deal with the non-linear boundary conditions at the top surface due to the presence of ice/snow fluxes have to be calculated by the QTF model and temperature calculated from the surface heat balance. This requires some iteration. Note, top surface variables correspond to ‘outside’ variables in standard CTF/QTF definition. Bottom surface variables correspond to ‘inside’ variables.</p>
<p>For given current surface temperatures the terms of the QTF equations can be grouped into constant terms, and those depending on the current source flux. The surface heat balance may be given by the following equation (Strand,1997)</p>

<p>This component (Object: HeatExchanger:FluidToFluid) is a simple hydronic heat exchanger that can be used to couple two (hydronic) plant or condenser loops.  Sizing and nominal capacity calculations are discussed elsewhere in this document, see the section called Plant Heat Exchanger Sizing. This section first discusses the heat transfer modeling and the control issues.</p>
<p>Heat exchanger performance modeling uses classic effectiveness-NTU correlations. The heat exchanger model can be specified as one of seven types:  cross flow both fluid streams unmixed, cross flow both fluid streams mixed, cross flow maximum capacity flow mixed min), counter flow, parallel flow, or ideal. The model correlations determine a heat transfer effectiveness value, <div img="image5740.txt">(\varepsilon )</div>, which is a function of heat exchanger UA, the mass flow rates through boths sides, and the specific heat of the fluids in the streams.  The effectiveness of an ideal heat exchanger is set to 1.0 and no correlation is needed.</p>
<p>Because the heat exchanger is intended to be generic, its two sides are distinguished by the nature of loop side being connected.  One side is called “Loop Supply Side” to indicate the heat exchanger is situated on the supply side of a loop. The other side is called “Loop Demand Side” to indicate it is on the demand side of a loop.  The heat exchanger is intended to act as a supply component for the loop connected to it as the “Loop Supply Side” and as a demand component for the loop connected to it as the “Loop Demand Side.”  From the point of view of the heat exchanger component itself, the Loop Demand Side acts like a supply source/sink for the Loop Supply Side which acts like a demand to the component.</p>
<p>The mass flow rates and specific heat capacity are multiplied together to evaluate flow thermal capacity for each side and the minimum, maximum, and capacity ratio, <div img="image5741.txt">({R_C})</div>, are determined.</p>
<div>\[{\left( {\dot m{c_p}} \right)_{SupLoop}} = {\dot m_{SupLoop}}*{c_p}_{SupLoop}\]</div>

<div>\[{\left( {\dot m{c_p}} \right)_{DmdLoop}} = {\dot m_{DmdLoop}}*{c_p}_{DmdLoop}\]</div>

<div>\[{\left( {\dot m{c_p}} \right)_{Min}} = MIN\left( {{{\left( {\dot m{c_p}} \right)}_{SupLoop}},{{\left( {\dot m{c_p}} \right)}_{DmdLoop}}} \right)\]</div>

<div>\[{R_C} = \frac{{{{\left( {\dot m{c_p}} \right)}_{Min}}}}{{{{\left( {\dot m{c_p}} \right)}_{Max}}}}\]</div>

<p>NTU, or Number of Transfer Units, is calculated using:</p>
<div>\[NTU = \frac{{UA}}{{{{\left( {\dot m{c_p}} \right)}_{Min}}}}\]</div>

<p>For a counter flow heat exchanger, effectiveness is calculated using:</p>
<div>\[\varepsilon  = \frac{{1 - exp\left[ { - NTU\left( {1 - {R_C}} \right)} \right]}}{{1 - {R_C}exp\left[ { - NTU\left( {1 - Rc} \right)} \right]}}\]</div>

<p>For a parallel flow heat exchanger, effectiveness is calculated using:</p>
<div>\[\varepsilon  = \frac{{1 - exp\left[ { - NTU\left( {1 + {R_C}} \right)} \right]}}{{\left( {1 + {R_C}} \right)}}\]</div>

<p>For a cross flow heat exchanger with both streams unmixed, effectiveness is calculated using:</p>
<div>\[\varepsilon  = 1 - exp\left\{ {\frac{{NT{U^{0.22}}}}{{{R_C}}}\left[ {exp\left( { - {R_C}NT{U^{0.78}}} \right) - 1} \right]} \right\}\]</div>

<p>For a cross flow heat exchanger with both streams mixed, the effectiveness is calculated using:</p>
<div>\[\varepsilon  = {\left[ {\frac{1}{{1 - exp\left( { - NTU} \right)}} + \frac{{{R_C}}}{{1 - exp\left( { - {R_C}NTU} \right)}} - \frac{1}{{NTU}}} \right]^{ - 1}}\]</div>

<p>For a cross flow heat exchanger with the stream with the higher capacity mixed and the stream with the lower capacity unmixed, the effectiveness is calculated using:</p>
<div>\[\varepsilon  = \frac{1}{{{R_C}}}\left\{ {1 - exp\left[ {{R_C}\left( {exp\left( { - NTU} \right) - 1} \right)} \right]} \right\}\]</div>

<p>For a cross flow heat exchanger with the stream with higher capacity unmixed and the stream with lower capacity mixed, the effectiveness is calculated using:</p>
<div>\[\varepsilon  = 1 - exp\left\{ { - \frac{1}{{{R_C}}}\left[ {1 - exp\left( { - {R_C}NTU} \right)} \right]} \right\}\]</div>

<p>Effectiveness values are always limited to be no higher than 1.0.  The program code protects from evaluating the exponential with operands that are too large or too small. Once the effectiveness value is determined, the heat transfer rate is calculated using:</p>
<div>\[\dot Q = \varepsilon {\left( {\dot m{c_p}} \right)_{Min}}\left( {{T_{SupLoop,In}} - {T_{DmdLoop,In}}} \right)\]</div>

<p>Lastly, the fluid temperatures leaving the heat exchanger are calculated using:</p>
<div>\[{T_{SupLoop,Out}} = {T_{SupLoop,In}} - \frac{{\dot Q}}{{{{\left( {\dot m{c_p}} \right)}_{SupLoop}}}}\]</div>

<div>\[{T_{DmdLoop,Out}} = {T_{DmdLoop,In}} + \frac{{\dot Q}}{{{{\left( {\dot m{c_p}} \right)}_{DmdLoop}}}}\]</div>

<p>The plant heat exchanger offers a number of control options for a wide variety of applications.  This section documents the control decision logic. The general goal of the control is to provide appropriate conditioning of the fluid at the Loop Supply Side connection.  The basic control action is to request the appropriate flow rates for each side of the heat exchanger.  For all of the control modes, there is also an availability schedule that provides a level of supervisory control to determine if the heat exchange is available to run at all.  If the device is scheduled off, then zero flow is requested for both connections. All the control modes can also use minimum and maximum temperature limits.  If the limits are used and either of the two inlet temperatures exceeds the limit, the zero flow is requested for both connections.</p>
<p><strong>UncontrolledOn. </strong> This control type is very simple.  If scheduled on it requests the full design flow rate on the Loop Supply Side connection.  If the Loop Supply Side flow rate exceeds a small tolerance, then the full design flow rate is requested for the Loop Demand Side connection.</p>
<p><strong>OperationSchemeModulated. </strong> This control type uses the plant operation schemes. Any of the various plant (or condenser) operation schemes (e.g. PlantEquipmentOperation:CoolingLoad or PlantEquipmentOperation:HeatingLoad ). When the heat exchanger is called, the operation scheme will pass a value for the load to be met.  If the absolute value of the load is less than a small tolerance (1 W), then zero flow is requested for both connections.  If load is significant and negative, then the heat exchanger will attempt to provide cooling.  If the load is significant and positive, then it will attempt to provide heating.  The two inlet fluid temperatures are compared and if their difference exceeds the minimum temperature difference and has the correct sign for heating or cooling as needed, then the heat exchanger is turned “on.”  The model requests the full design flow rate on the Loop Supply Side connection.  If the Loop Supply Side flow rate exceeds a small tolerance, then a flow rate for the Loop Demand Side is found to attempt to meet the load.  The load value is converted to a target temperature for the fluid leaving the Loop Supply Side connection.  The target temperature is then used with the numerical method Regula Falsi to solve for the flow rate.</p>
<p><strong>OperationSchemeOnOff</strong>.  This control type uses the plant operation schemes. Any of the various plant (or condenser) operation schemes (e.g. PlantEquipmentOperation:CoolingLoad or PlantEquipmentOperation:HeatingLoad). When the heat exchanger is called, the operation scheme will pass a value for the load to be met.  If the absolute value of the load is less than a small tolerance (1 W), then zero flow is requested for both connections.  If load is significant and negative, then the heat exchanger will attempt to provide cooling.  If the load is significant and positive, then it will attempt to provide heating.  The two inlet fluid temperatures are compared and if their difference exceeds the minimum temperature difference and has the correct sign for heating or cooling as is needed, then the heat exchanger is turned “on.”  The model requests the full design flow rate on the Loop Supply Side connection.  If the Loop Supply Side flow rate exceeds a small tolerance, then the full design flow rate is requested for the Loop Demand Side connection.</p>
<p><strong>HeatingSetpointModulated</strong>.  This control scheme uses a node setpoint. The two inlet fluid temperatures are compared to see if their difference exceeds the minimum temperature difference and has the correct sign for heating to be possible.  The temperature setpoint on the reference node is compared to the inlet temperature for the Loop Supply Side to see if heating is desired.  If heating is both desired and possible, then the heat exchanger is turned “on.”  The model requests the full design flow rate on the Loop Supply Side connection.  If the Loop Supply Side flow rate exceeds a small tolerance, then a flow rate for the Loop Demand Side is found to attempt to meet the setpoint.  The setpoint temperature is then used with the numerical method Regula Falsi to solve for the flow rate.</p>
<p><strong>HeatingSetpointOnOff</strong>.  This control scheme uses a node setpoint. The two inlet fluid temperatures are compared to see if their difference exceeds the minimum temperature difference and has the correct sign for heating to be possible.  The temperature setpoint on the reference node is compared to the inlet temperature for the Loop Supply Side to see if heating is desired.  If heating is both desired and possible, then the heat exchanger is turned “on.”  The model requests the full design flow rate on the Loop Supply Side connection.  If the Loop Supply Side flow rate exceeds a small tolerance, then the full design flow rate is requested for the Loop Demand Side connection.</p>
<p><strong>CoolingSetpointModulated</strong>.  This control scheme uses a node setpoint. The two inlet fluid temperatures are compared to see if their difference exceeds the minimum temperature difference and has the correct sign for cooling to be possible.  The temperature setpoint on the reference node is compared to the inlet temperature for the Loop Supply Side to see if cooling is desired.  If cooling is both desired and possible, then the heat exchanger is turned “on.”  The model requests the full design flow rate on the Loop Supply Side connection.  If the Loop Supply Side flow rate exceeds a small tolerance, then a flow rate for the Loop Demand Side is found to attempt to meet the setpoint.  The setpoint temperature is then used with the numerical method Regula Falsi to solve for the flow rate.</p>
<p><strong>CoolingSetpointOnOff</strong>.  This control scheme uses a node setpoint. The two inlet fluid temperatures are compared to see if their difference exceeds the minimum temperature difference and has the correct sign for cooling to be possible.  The temperature setpoint on the reference node is compared to the inlet temperature for the Loop Supply Side to see if cooling is desired.  If cooling is both desired and possible, then the heat exchanger is turned “on.”  The model requests the full design flow rate on the Loop Supply Side connection.  If the Loop Supply Side flow rate exceeds a small tolerance, then the full design flow rate is requested for the Loop Demand Side connection.</p>
<p><strong>CoolingSetpointOnOffWithComponentOverride</strong>.  This control scheme uses one of three different control signals, a node setpoint, outdoor air drybulb temperature, or outdoor air wetbulb temperature. The two inlet fluid temperatures are compared to see if their difference exceeds the minimum temperature difference and has the correct sign for cooling to be possible.  The control signal is compared to the inlet temperature for the Loop Supply Side to see if cooling is desired.  If cooling is both desired and possible, then the heat exchanger is turned “on.”  When the heat exchanger is on, the remote chiller component is turned off.  The model requests the full design flow rate on the Loop Supply Side connection.  If the Loop Supply Side flow rate exceeds a small tolerance, then the full design flow rate is requested for the Loop Demand Side connection.</p>
<p><strong>CoolingDifferentialOnOff</strong>.  This control scheme is based on a simple temperature difference. The two inlet fluid temperatures are compared to see if their difference exceeds the minimum temperature difference and has the correct sign for cooling to be possible.  If cooling is possible then it is assumed to be desired and the heat exchanger is turned “on.”  The model requests the full design flow rate on the Loop Supply Side connection.  If the Loop Supply Side flow rate exceeds a small tolerance, then the full design flow rate is requested for the Loop Demand Side connection.</p>
<p><strong>DualDeadbandSetpointModulated</strong>.  This control scheme uses dual setpoints on a node. The basic idea is that the heat exchanger will condition the Loop Supply Side connection to drive its temperature into the deadband whenever its inlet temperature is outside the deadband.  The model expects dual temperature setpoints to be placed on the setpoint, for example using the object SetpointManager:Scheduled:DualSetpoint.</p>
<p>The heat exchanger will operate to cool the Loop Supply Side fluid when the following three conditions are all met:</p>
<p>1)  the two inlet fluid temperatures are compared to see if their difference exceeds the minimum temperature difference and has the correct sign for cooling to be possible,</p>
<p>2) the higher temperature setpoint on the reference node is compared to the inlet temperature for the Loop Supply Side to see if their difference exceeds the minimum temperature difference and has the correct sign for cooling to be possible, and</p>
<p>3)  the higher temperature setpoint on the reference node is compared to the inlet temperature for the Loop Demand Side to see if their difference exceeds the minimum temperature difference and has the correct sign for cooling to be possible.</p>
<p>The heat exchanger will operate to heat the Loop Supply Side fluid when the following three conditions are all met:</p>

<p>2)  the lower temperature setpoint on the reference node is compared to the inlet temperature for the Loop Supply Side to see if their difference exceeds the minimum temperature difference and has the correct sign for heating to be possible, and</p>
<p>3) the lower temperature setpoint on the reference node is compared to the inlet temperature for the Loop Demand Side to see if their difference exceeds the minimum temperature difference and has the correct sign for heating to be possible.</p>
<p>When the heat exchanger is turned “on.”  The model requests the full design flow rate on the Loop Supply Side connection.  If the Loop Supply Side flow rate exceeds a small tolerance, then a flow rate for the Loop Demand Side is found to attempt to meet the setpoint.  The setpoint temperature is then used with the numerical method Regula Falsi to solve for the flow rate.</p>
<p><strong>DualDeadbandSetpointOnOff</strong>. This control scheme uses dual setpoints on a node.

<h3 id="overview_18">Overview</h3>
<p>Air system humidifiers are components that add moisture to the supply air stream. They fall into 2 broad categories: spray type humidifiers which act like direct evaporative coolers, cooling the supply air as well as humidifying it; and dry steam humidifiers, which humidify the supply air stream while causing almost no change to the supply air stream temperature. The EnergyPlus electric and gas fired steam humidifier uses electrical energy and thermal energy, respectively, to convert ordinary tap water to steam which it then injects into the supply air stream by means of a blower fan. The actual electric dry steam unit might be an electrode-type humidifier or a resistance-type humidifier.</p>
<h3 id="electric-and-gas-steam-humidifier">Electric and Gas Steam Humidifier</h3>
<p>The electric and gas steam humidifier models (object names: Humidifier:Steam:Electric and Humidifier:Steam:Gas) are based on moisture and enthalpy balance equations plus standard psychrometric relationships. The approach is similar to that taken in the ASHRAE HVAC 2 Toolkit, page 4-112 (ASHRAE 1993). EnergyPlus contains its own module of psychrometric routines; the psychrometric theory and relations are given in the 2001 edition of ASHRAE Fundamentals, Chapter 6 (ASHRAE 2001). The model contains both an ideal controller and the component. The control model assumes that there is a minimum humidity setpoint on the component air outlet node. This setpoint is established by a setpoint manager described elsewhere.</p>
<h4 id="model_1">Model</h4>
<p>The component model is a forward model: its inputs are its inlet conditions; its outputs are its outlet conditions and its energy consumption. The inputs are the temperature, humidity ratio, and mass flow rate of the inlet air stream, which are known; and the water addition rate (kg/s) which is determined by the controller.  The moisture mass balance and psychometric calculations are identical for both gas and electric dry steam humidifiers.  The only difference is how a heat source (electric or gas) is used to generate the steam.</p>
<h4 id="controller">Controller</h4>
<p>The controller first decides whether the humidifier is on or off. For the humidifier to be on:</p>
<p>* the humidifier schedule value must be nonzero;</p>
<p>* the inlet air mass flow must be greater than zero;</p>
<p>* the inlet air humidity ratio must be less than the minimum humidity ratio setpoint.</p>
<p>If the humidifier is off, the water addition rate is set to zero. If the humidifier is on, the water addition rate needed to meet the humidity setpoint is calculated.</p>

<p>The inputs to the component model are the air inlet conditions and mass flow rate and the water addition rate set by the controller. The outputs are the air outlet conditions. First the desired water addition rate is checked against component capacity.</p>

<p>IF <div img="image5788.txt">({w_{out}} \le {w_{out,sat}})</div> then the outlet condition is below the saturation curve and the desired moisture addition rate can be met. <div img="image5789.txt">({\dot m_{w,add}})</div> is set to <div img="image5790.txt">({\dot m_{w,add,needed,{\rm{max}}}})</div> and the calculation of outlet conditions is done. But if <div img="image5791.txt">({w_{out}} &gt; {w_{out,sat}})</div> then it is assumed that this condition will be detected and the steam addition rate throttled back to bring the outlet conditions back to the saturation condition. We need to find the point where the line drawn between state 1 (inlet) and state 2 (our desired outlet) crosses the saturation curve. This will be the new outlet condition. Rather than iterate to obtain this point, we find it approximately by solving for the point where 2 lines cross: the first drawn from state 1 to state 2, the second from <div img="image5792.txt">({T_1})</div>, <div img="image5793.txt">({w_{1,sat}})</div> to <div img="image5794.txt">({T_2})</div>, <div img="image5795.txt">({w_{2,sat}})</div>; where</p>

<p>is the humidity ratio at saturation at temperature <div img="image5801.txt">({T_2})</div> [kg/kg].</p>
<p>The 2 lines are given by the equations:</p>
<div>\[w = {w_1} + (({w_2} - {w_1})/({T_2} - {T_1})) \cdot (T - {T_1})\]</div>

<div>\[w = {w_{1,sat}} + (({w_{2,sat}} - {w_{1,sat}})/({T_2} - {T_1})) \cdot (T - {T_1})\]</div>

<p>Solving for the point (state 3) where the lines cross:</p>
<div>\[{w_3} = {w_1} + (({w_2} - {w_1}) \cdot ({w_{1,sat}} - {w_1}))/({w_2} - {w_{2,sat}} + {w_{1,sat}} - {w_1})\]</div>

<div>\[{T_3} = {T_1} + ({w_3} - {w_1}) \cdot (({T_2} - {T_1})/({w_2} - {w_1}))\]</div>

<p>This point isn't quite on the saturation curve since we made a linear approximation of the curve, but the temperature should be very close to the correct outlet temperature. We will use this temperature as the outlet temperature and move to the saturation curve for the outlet humidity and enthalpy. Thus we set <div img="image5806.txt">({T_{out}})</div> = <div img="image5807.txt">({T_3})</div> and</p>
<div>\[{w_{out}} = PsyWFnTdbRhPb({T_{out}},1.0,{P_{atmo}})\]</div>

<div>\[{h_{out}} = PsyHFnTdbW({T_{out}},{w_{out}})\]</div>

<p>where <div img="image5810.txt">(PsyHFnTdbW)</div> is an EnergyPlus psychrometric function. The water addition rate is set to</p>
<div>\[{\dot m_{w,add}} = {\dot m_a} \cdot ({w_{out}} - {w_{in}})\]</div>

<p>We now have the outlet conditions and the adjusted steam addition rate for the case where the desired outlet humidity results in an outlet state above the saturation curve.  The energy consumption of the electric and gas steam humidifiers is calculated separately.</p>
<p>The electric steam humidifier electric consumption is given by</p>
<div>\[{W_{hum}} = ({\dot m_{w,add}}/Ca{p_{nom}}) \cdot {W_{nom}} + {W_{fan}} + {W_{stby}}\]</div>

<p>The gas steam humidifier performance calculation is done for fixed and variable entering water temperature. The calculation procedure for fixed and variable entering water temperature are as follows.</p>

<p>The gas use rate is determined from the theoretical gas input rate and actual thermal efficiency. The actual thermal efficiency is the rated thermal efficiency corrected for part load ratio operation. At steady state the gas use rate is given by:</p>
<div>\[ Q_{NG}=\frac{\dot{m}_w \left(h_{fg}+c_{p,w}\left(100-T_{w,inlet}\right)\right)}{\eta_{rated}} \]</div>

<div>\[ \rm{PLR} = \frac{\dot{Q}_{NG}}{Q_{NG,nom}} \]</div>

<div>\[ \eta_{actual} = \eta_{rated} \times \rm{EffModCurveValue}\left(PLR\right) \]</div>

<div>\[ Q_{NG}=\dot{Q}_{NG}\frac{\eta_{rated}}{\eta_{actual}} \]</div>

<p>where,
T_w_inlet = temperature of water entering the gas steam humidifier, °C. This value depends on the water source.  </p>
<p>If the rated gas use rated input field is not autosized, then user specified thermal efficiency will be overriden with a value calculated from user specified rated gas use rate, nominal  capacity (m3/s) and design conditions as follows:</p>
<div>\[ \eta_{rated}=\frac{\dot{V}_{cap,nom} \rho_w \left(h_{fg}+c_{p,w}\Delta T_w}{Q_{NG,nom}} \]</div>

<p>The gas steam humidifier requires electric power input to the blower fan and associated control units.  The auxiliary electric power input rate of the gas steam humidifier is given by:</p>
<div>\[W_{aux} = W_{fan} + W_{controls}\]</div>

<p>where
W_fan = nominal fan power [W], a user input,
W_controls = control electric power [W], a user input.</p>
<p>The water consumption rate is, in m3/s, for electric and steam humidifier at a reference temperature of 5.05 C is given by.</p>
<div>\[{\dot V_{cons}} = {\dot m_{w,add}}/{\rho_w}\]</div>

<p>where</p>
<div img="image5816.txt">\({\dot V_{cons}}\)</div>

<p>= the water consumption rate [m<sup>3</sup>],</p>
<div img="image5817.txt">\({\rho_w}\)</div>

<p>= water density (998.2 kg/m<sup>3</sup>).</p>
