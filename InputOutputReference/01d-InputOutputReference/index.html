          <h2 id="group-zone-controls-thermostats-and-humidistats">Group – Zone Controls – Thermostats and Humidistats</h2>
<p>Zone Control objects are used to control zone conditions to a specific setpoint. The six types of zone control are described in this section. They are, by name, ZoneControl:<strong>&lt;name&gt;.</strong>. These types are:</p>
<p><strong>Thermostat</strong> – The object provides the traditional approach to space control using air temperatures. Each controlled zone contains a thermostat object.</p>
<p><strong>Humidistat</strong> – The object is used to control a zone to a specified relative humidity.</p>
<p><strong>Thermostat:ThermalComfort</strong> – The object provides a method to control a zone to a dry-bulb temperature setpoint based on a thermal comfort model (e.g. Fanger) and a user-specified thermal comfort setpoint schedule.</p>
<p><strong>Thermostat:OperativeTemperature</strong> – The operative temperature control is formulated to reuse all of the traditional thermostat objects. One input object will be used for each thermal zone to indicate if that zone’s thermostat control mode should be overridden to effect operative temperature control rather than traditional air temperature control. The user will still have to input all the traditional ZoneControl:Thermostat and setpoint objects.</p>
<p><strong>Thermostat:TemperatureAndHumidity –</strong> This thermostat control works together with the traditional ZoneControl:Thermostat object to modify temperature control based on zone air humidity conditions. Currently, this object resets the thermostat’s cooling setpoint temperature downward based on elevated zone air humidity levels, typically yielding additional cooling coil operation and associated dehumidification. A ZoneControl:Thermostat:TemperatureAndHumidity object should be specified to indicate if a zone’s traditional thermostat control mode should be overridden to provide enhanced dehumidification. The user must still input the traditional ZoneControl:Thermostat and setpoint objects.</p>
<p><strong>Thermostat</strong>:<strong>StagedDualSetpoint –</strong> This thermostat control works alone with “Duel Setpoint” type only. The object provides heating and cooling setpoints, throttling range and offsets, so that zone temperature setpoint used for system load calculation is adjusted by the setpoint and throttling range based on the zone temperature at the previous time step. The stage number is determined by the temperature difference between the setpoint and zone temperature at the previous time step, and offset values. If this object and other zone control thermostat and humidistat are assigned to the same controlled zone, this object takes precedence when the controlled zone is specified in the Controlling Zone or Thermostat Location field of the AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:AirToAir:MultiSpeed object.</p>
<h3 id="zonecontrolthermostat">ZoneControl:Thermostat</h3>
<p>The thermostatic zone control object is used to control a zone to a specified temperature. ZoneControl:Thermostat references a control type schedule and one or more control type objects which in turn reference one or more setpoint schedules. The example at the end of this section illustrates a complete zone thermostat specification including the control type and setpoint schedules.</p>
<p>The control type schedule and the list of control type/name pairs are directly related. The schedule defines the type of control that is to be used throughout the simulation. Valid Control Types are:</p>
<p>0 - Uncontrolled (No specification or default)</p>
<p>1 - Single Heating Setpoint</p>
<p>2 - Single Cooling SetPoint</p>
<p>3 - Single Heating/Cooling Setpoint</p>
<p>4 - Dual Setpoint (Heating and Cooling) with deadband</p>
<p>Thus, if the schedule referenced in the ZoneControl:Thermostat statement has a control type of 4 for a particular time period, this indicates that during that time period "Dual Setpoint with deadband” control is to be used. The specific "Dual Setpoint (Heating and Cooling) with deadband" control object to be used is specified in the list of control type/name pairs. Then the specific control type objects reference the thermostat setpoint temperature schedule to be used. Because only one control can be specified for each control type in a ZoneControl:Thermostat statement, there are only four pairs possible in a particular ZoneControl:Thermostat type/name list. This is because individual controls can be defined throughout the simulation, thus giving the user a full range of flexibility. Since putting in the name of the control type directly in the schedule would be very cumbersome, the control types are assigned a number which is used in the schedule profile.</p>
<h4 id="field-name">Field: Name</h4>
<p>Unique identifying name for the thermostat.</p>
<h4 id="field-zone-or-zonelist-name">Field: Zone or ZoneList Name</h4>
<p>Name of the zone or set of zones that is being controlled. When the ZoneList option is used then this thermostat definition is applied to each of the zones in the zone list effecting a global definition for thermostatic control in the zone.</p>
<h4 id="field-control-type-schedule-name">Field: Control Type Schedule Name</h4>
<p>Schedule which defines what type of control is active during the simulation. Valid Control Types are:</p>
<p>0 - Uncontrolled (No specification or default)</p>
<p>1 - Single Heating Setpoint</p>
<p>2 - Single Cooling SetPoint</p>
<p>3 - Single Heating Cooling Setpoint</p>
<p>4 - Dual Setpoint with Deadband (Heating and Cooling)</p>
<p>Each non-zero control type which is used in this schedule must appear in the following fields which list the specific thermostat control objects to be used for this zone.</p>
<h4 id="field-set-control-object-type-control-name">Field Set (Control Object Type, Control Name)</h4>
<p>Up to four pairs of Control Object Type and Control Name may be listed to specify which control objects are used for this zone. This list is not order-dependent, and the position in this list has no impact on the control type schedule. In the control type schedule, a value of 1 always means "Single Heating Setpoint", even if that control type is not first in this list.</p>
<h4 id="field-control-object-xtype">Field: Control Object &lt;x&gt;Type</h4>
<p>This field specifies the control type to be used for this zone. Available control types are:</p>

<h4 id="zone-predicted-sensible-load-to-setpoint-heat-transfer-rate-w">Zone Predicted Sensible Load to Setpoint Heat Transfer Rate [W]</h4>
<p>This is the predicted sensible load in W required to meet the current zone thermostat setpoint. A positive value indicates a heating load, a negative value indicates a cooling load. This is calculated and reported from the Predict step in the Zone Predictor-Corrector module. For nearly all equipment types, the Predictor-Corrector evaluates the active heating and/or cooling setpoints, determines if the zone requires heating or cooling or is in the deadband, and then passes this single load to the equipment. This value is not multiplied by zone or group multipliers.</p>
<h4 id="zone-predicted-sensible-load-to-heating-setpoint-heat-transfer-rate-w">Zone Predicted Sensible Load to Heating Setpoint Heat Transfer Rate [W]</h4>
<p>This is the predicted sensible load in W required to meet the current zone thermostat heating setpoint. A positive value indicates a heating load, a negative value indicates a cooling load. This is calculated and reported from the Predict step in the Zone Predictor-Corrector module. This value is not multiplied by zone or group multipliers.</p>
<h4 id="zone-predicted-sensible-load-to-cooling-setpoint-heat-transfer-rate-w">Zone Predicted Sensible Load to Cooling Setpoint Heat Transfer Rate [W]</h4>

This is calculated and reported from the Predict step in the Zone Predictor-Corrector module. This value is not multiplied by zone or group multipliers.</p>
<h4 id="zone-thermostat-control-type">Zone Thermostat Control Type []</h4>
<p>This is the current zone thermostat control type (0 through 4). This value is set at each zone timestep. Using the averaged value for longer reporting frequencies (hourly, for example) may not be meaningful in some applications.</p>
<h4 id="zone-thermostat-heating-setpoint-temperature-c">Zone Thermostat Heating Setpoint Temperature [C]</h4>
<p>This is the current zone thermostat heating setpoint in degrees C. If there is no heating thermostat active, then the value will be 0. This value is set at each zone timestep. Using the averaged value for longer reporting frequencies (hourly, for example) may not be meaningful in some applications.</p>
<p>When the Thermostat:StagedDualSetpoint object is applied to the current zone, this output variable reports staged zone heating setpoint. When the staged number is not equal to zero, both staged heating and cooling setpoints are the same. When no cooling or heating is required, the staged heating setpoint is equal to the scheduled heating setpoint – 0.5 * heating throttling range, and the staged cooling setpoint is equal to the scheduled cooling setpoint + 0.5 * cooling throttling range.</p>
<h4 id="zone-thermostat-cooling-setpoint-temperature-c">Zone Thermostat Cooling Setpoint Temperature [C]</h4>
<p>This is the current zone thermostat cooling setpoint in degrees C. If there is no cooling thermostat active, then the value will be 0. This value is set at each zone timestep. Using the averaged value for longer reporting frequencies (hourly, for example) may not be meaningful in some applications.</p>
<p>When the Thermostat:StagedDualSetpoint object is applied to the current zone, this output variable reports staged zone cooling setpoint. When the staged number is not equal to zero, both staged heating and cooling setpoints are the same.

<h4 id="zone-thermostat-stage-number">Zone Thermostat Stage Number []</h4>
<p>This is the current zone thermostat stage number when the ZoneControl:Thermostat:StagedDualSetpoint object is specified in this zone. When no heating or cooling is required, the stage number is set to 0. When heating is required, the stage number is positive. When cooling is required, the stage number is negative. The absolute number is sent to the AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:AirToAir:MultiSpeed object to specify the speed number accordingly.</p>

<h4 id="zone-oscillating-temperatures-timehr">Zone Oscillating Temperatures Time[hr]</h4>
<p>Hours when the temperature in the zone is oscillating back and forth. Oscillation is defined as times when the three differences between zone temperatures during successive timesteps are greater in magnitude than 0.15 degrees C and the sign of the differences changes from positive to negative to positive or from negative to positive to negative.</p>
<p>This may indicate a simulation with reduced reliability during the oscillation. Some oscillating hours should be expected in all simulations but excessive oscillations call into question the overall validity of the results. If excessive oscillations are occurring, try reducing the minimum system timestep (see ConvergenceLimits object) and the zone timestep (see the TimeStep object). Reducing these timestep lengths does increase the total computer time needed to complete the simulation. Having the zone timestep and the minimum system timestep the same length of time can also cause more oscillations. What amount of oscillations is considered “excessive” is difficult to quantify. One approach is comparing the number of oscillations to the case with 15 minute zone timesteps (4 per hour) and 1 minute minimum system timesteps. Often this variable is used as an indicator of the validity of the results when trying to decrease the time needed to perform the simulation.</p>

<h3 id="zonecontrolthermostatoperativetemperature">ZoneControl:Thermostat:OperativeTemperature</h3>
<p>This object is used to modify the program’s behavior for ZoneControl:Thermostat objects. One input object is used for each thermal zone to indicate if that zone’s thermostat control mode should be overridden to effect operative temperature control rather than traditional air temperature control. Zone Control:Thermostatic and related set point objects also need to be included in the input file. When this object is used, the zone can be controlled by a weighted mixture of radiant and air temperatures (rather than just air temperatures).</p>
<p>This thermostatic operative temperature, <span>${T_{OP}}$</span>, is defined as:</p>
<div>\[{T_{OP}} = \gamma {T_{MRT}} + (1 - \gamma ){T_{drybulb}}\]</div>

<p>where,</p>
<p><span>$\gamma $</span>  is the radiative fraction,</p>
<p><span>${T_{MRT}}$</span> is the mean radiant temperature for the thermal zone, and</p>
<p><span>${T_{drybulb}}$</span>is the mean zone air temperature.</p>
<p>The radiative fraction <span>$\gamma $</span> is selected by the user and can be scheduled to vary during the simulation. A typical value is 0.5. The maximum value needs to be less than 0.9 and the minimum is 0.0. A value of 0.0 is the same as controlling on only zone air temperature. If air velocities are higher than 0.2 m/s, then lower values for radiative fraction might apply. Niu and Burnett (1998) cite International Standard ISO 77300 in recommending the values for this fraction listed in the following table.</p>

<h4 id="field-thermostat-name">Field: Thermostat Name</h4>
<p>Name of ZoneControl:Thermostat object defined elsewhere in the input file whose operation is to be modified to effect control based on operative temperature. If the ZoneControl:Thermostat references a ZoneList (set of zones) then, this operative temperature thermostat will be applied to each of those zones. If only a single thermostat/zone is desired, then the name to be put here is &lt;zone name&gt; &lt;Thermostat Name&gt; where the Thermostat name is the thermostat that referenced the set of zones.</p>
<h4 id="field-radiative-fraction-input-mode">Field: Radiative Fraction Input Mode</h4>
<p>This field controls whether the input for radiative fraction is a constant value or if it is entered using a schedule. Enter “<strong>Constant</strong>” here to use a fixed radiative fraction defined in the following field. Enter “<strong>Scheduled</strong>” to vary the radiative fraction according to the schedule named in the second field below.</p>
<h4 id="field-fixed-radiative-fraction">Field: Fixed Radiative Fraction</h4>
<p>This is the fraction, <span>$\gamma $</span>, of the operative temperature that is due to the mean radiant temperature in the zone. This field is used by the program if the previous field is set to <strong>Constant</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="field-radiative-fraction-schedule-name">Field: Radiative Fraction Schedule Name</h4>
<p>This field contains the name of a schedule, defined elsewhere, that determines the value for radiative fraction <span>$\gamma $</span> during the simulation period. This schedule should have fractional values from 0.0 to 0.9. When the value of this schedule is 0.0, the controlling will be equivalent to control based only on zone air temperature. This field is used by the program if the Input Mode field is set to <strong>Scheduled</strong>.</p>
<p>Note that by setting the values in this schedule separately for design days, the user can control how operative temperature control is applied during autosizing. (Operative temperature control tends to increase the equipment capacities calculated during sizing.)</p>

<p>Operative temperature (OT) is a weighted mixture of Zone Mean Air Temperature (MAT) and Zone Mean Radiant Temperature (MRT), using the current value of Radiative Fraction (RF):  OT = (1-RF)*MAT + RF*MAT.  This output variable does not include the direct effect of high temperature radiant systems.  See also Zone Operative Temperature.</p>
<h3 id="zonecontrolthermostattemperatureandhumidity">ZoneControl:Thermostat:TemperatureAndHumidity</h3>
<p>This object is used to modify the behavior of ZoneControl:Thermostat objects (control types ThermostatSetpoint:SingleCooling and ThermostatSetpoint:DualSetpoint only) based on zone air humidity conditions. Specifically, this TemperatureAndHumidity zone control resets the ZoneControl:Thermostat’s cooling setpoint temperature downward when the zone air relative humidity exceeds the Dehumidifying Relative Humidity Setpoint defined in this object. The reduced cooling setpoint temperature typically results in longer cooling coil runtimes and additional dehumidification. The rate at which the cooling setpoint temperature is reduced is dictated by the user-specified Overcool Control Ratio. The maximum reduction in cooling setpoint temperature is defined by the user-entered OverCool Range (user choice of a constant value for the entire simulation or a schedule that can define how the overcool range varies over time). For details regarding the calculations, see the EnergyPlus Engineering Reference.</p>
<p>Note: As described above, this ZoneControl:Thermostat:TemperatureAndHumidity control object modifies the cooling setpoint temperature of ZoneControl:Thermostat objects. The ZoneControl:Thermostat:TemperatureAndHumidity  object works independently of the ZoneControl:Humidistat object; that is, it does not replace the need for, or coordinate its input fields with, ZoneControl:Humidistat objects that are required for other types of high humidity control (e.g., ZoneControl:Humidstat objects are required for ZoneHVAC:Dehumidifier:DX objects, AirLoopHVAC:Unitary* objects with “CoolReheat” or “MultiMode” dehumidification control types, etc.)</p>
<h4 id="field-thermostat-name_1">Field: Thermostat Name</h4>

If the ZoneControl:Thermostat references a ZoneList (set of zones), then simply enter the name of the ZoneControl:Thermostat object and this TemperatureAndHumidity thermostat control will be applied to all zones in the ZoneList. If the ZoneControl:Thermostat references a ZoneList but it is desired that only a single zone within the ZoneList be controlled based on TemperatureAndHumidity control, then the name to be put here is &lt;zone name&gt; &lt;Thermostat Name&gt; where the Thermostat Name is the name of the ZoneControl:Thermostat object.</p>

This input field is required.  This input field has absolutely no relationship or influence on the Dehumidifying Relative Humidity Setpoint Schedule Name optional input field in the ZoneControl:Humidistat object.</p>
<h4 id="fielddehumidification-control-type">Field:Dehumidification Control Type</h4>
<p>This input field defines what type of dehumidification control is active during the simulation. Valid control types are None and Overcool. The default is Overcool if this field is left blank.  Overcool resets the thermostat’s cooling setpoint temperature lower based on the zone air relative humidity level. None means no overcooling (i.e., traditional zone air temperature control based on the associated ZoneControl:Thermostat object [Thermostat Name input field above] will be in effect).</p>

<p>This field controls whether the input for the overcool (temperature) range is a constant value or if it is entered using a schedule. Enter “<strong>Constant</strong>” here to use a constant overcool range defined in the ”Overcool Constant Range” input field below. Enter “<strong>Scheduled</strong>” to vary the overcool range according to the schedule named in the ”Overcool Range Schedule Name” input field below. The default is “<strong>Constant</strong>” if this field is left blank.</p>
<h4 id="field-overcool-constant-range">Field: Overcool Constant Range</h4>
<p>This field specifies a fixed maximum overcool temperature range for cooling setpoint temperature reduction for zone overcool dehumidification in units of deltaC.  This field is used if the Overcool Range Input Method is specified as <strong>Constant</strong>. The Overcool dehumidification control type only works with ZoneControl:Thermostat control types “ThermostatSetpoint:SingleCooling” and “ThermostatSetpoint:DualSetpoint”.  For “ThermostatSetpoint:DualSetpoint”,  the model will use the <strong>smaller</strong> of the Overcool Constant Range input value or the difference between the cooling and heating setpoint temperatures specified in the “ThermostatSetpoint:DualSetpoint” object. The Overcool Constant Range must be greater than or equal to zero with a maximum value of 3°C.  A value of 0.0 indicates no zone air overcooling. The default value is 1.7°C (3°F) if this input field is left blank.</p>
<h4 id="field-overcool-range-schedule-name">Field: Overcool Range Schedule Name</h4>
<p>This field contains the name of a schedule, defined elsewhere, that determines the value for the overcool range during the simulation period. This schedule should contain values from 0.0 to &lt;=3.0 (deltaC). When the value of this schedule is 0.0, the zone air temperature control will be based only on zone air dry-bulb temperature (i.e., no zone overcooling). This field is used by the program if the Overcool Range Input Method field is set to <strong>Scheduled</strong>. Overcool dehumidification control type only works with ZoneControl:Thermostat control types “ThermostatSetpoint:SingleCooling” and “ThermostatSetpoint:DualSetpoint”.  For “ThermostatSetpoint:DualSetpoint”,  the model will use the <strong>smaller</strong> of the Overcool Range values specified in this schedule or the difference between the cooling and heating setpoint temperatures specified in the “ThermostatSetpoint:DualSetpoint” object.</p>
<p>Note that by setting the values in this schedule separately for design days, the user can control how Overcool Dehumidification Control is applied during autosizing. (Overcool dehumidification control tends to increase the cooling equipment capacities calculated during sizing.)</p>
<h4 id="fieldovercool-control-ratio">Field:Overcool Control Ratio</h4>
<p>The value of this input field is used to adjust the cooling setpoint temperature (established by the associated ZoneControl:Thermostat object) downward based on the difference between the zone air relative humidity level and the Dehumidifying Relative Humidity Setpoint. This input field is only used with Dehumidification Control Type = Overcool.  Input values must be greater than or equal to 0.0 %RH/K. The default value is 3.6 if this field is left blank.</p>

<h3 id="zonecontrolthermostatstageddualsetpoint">ZoneControl:Thermostat:StagedDualSetpoint</h3>
<p>The thermostatic zone control staged dual setpoint object is used to control a zone to a specified temperature based on multiple stages. The other types of ZoneControl:Thermostat objects reference a control type schedule and one or more control type objects which in turn reference one or more setpoint schedules. This control object does not require a control type schedule and associated one or more control type objects. Instead, the object is defined as a “Dual Setpoint” type only and has two fields to provide heating and cooling setpoints. The object also provides two fields to specify heating and cooling throttling temperature ranges, so that predicted zone loads may be varied within the throttling ranges for both heating and cooling. The number of stages for both heating and cooling varies from 1 to 4 for the time being to match the number of speeds used in the AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:AirToAir:MultiSpeed object. The number of stages may be expanded later to accommodate other objects with the number of speeds higher than 4. The object requires inputs temperature offsets for both heating and cooling based on the number of stages. The stage number is determined by the temperature difference between the setpoint and zone temperature at the previous time step, and offset values. The staged number will be assigned to the speed number for the AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:AirToAir:MultiSpeed system type.</p>
<p>It should be pointed out that If this object and other zone control thermostat and humidistat are assigned to the same controlled zone, this object takes precedence when the controlled zone is specified in the Controlling Zone or Thermostat Location field of the AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:AirToAir:MultiSpeed object.</p>

<h3 id="zonecontrolhumidistat">ZoneControl:Humidistat</h3>
<p>The humidistat zone control object is used to control a zone to a single relative humidity setpoint schedule, or to dual humidity setpoint schedules (humidifying/ dehumidifying setpoints with deadband). The single setpoint humidistat requires single setpoint input only, and the dual-setpoint humidistat requires inputs of both humidifying and dehumidifying setpoints. The schedules consist of relative humidities, expressed as a percentage (0-100), to be used during the simulation for that zone’s moisture prediction calculation. Only one humidistat control statement can be specified for each zone. For a single setpoint humidistat, if the zone relative humidity is below the control relative humidity setpoint and the equipment specified can humidify then that equipment will try and meet the zone’s humidification load. The opposite is true if the zone relative humidity is above the control relative humidity setpoint and the equipment can dehumidify. For a dual setpoint humidistat, if the zone relative humidity is below the <strong>humidifying</strong> relative humidity setpoint and the equipment specified can humidify then that equipment will try and meet the zone’s humidification load. The opposite is true if the zone relative humidity is above the <strong>dehumidifying</strong> relative humidity setpoint and the equipment can dehumidify.</p>
<p>If the ZoneControl:Humidistat is used by a furnace or unitary system (Ref. Furnace and Unitary Systems) no other objects are required. The signal from the humidistat is used directly by that component. If the Zone Control:Humidistat object is used to control a Humidifier or used in conjunction with a Controller:WaterCoil object with control variable <strong>TemperatureAndHumidityRatio</strong> or <strong>HumidityRatio</strong>, the following objects are required to determine a setpoint for those components for a single setpoint humidistat:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>SetpointManager:SingleZone:Humidity:Minimum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SetpointManager:MultiZone:MinimumHumidity:Average</p>

<p>This is the predicted latent (moisture) load in kg<sub>water</sub>/s required to meet the current zone humidistat setpoint. A positive value indicates a humidification load, a negative value indicates a dehumidification load. For a dual setpoint humidistat, the value is zero when the controlled zone’s relative humidity is between the defined humidifying and dehumidifying setpoints. This moisture load rate is calculated and reported from the Predict step in the Zone Predictor-Corrector module. For nearly all equipment types, the Predictor-Corrector evaluates the active humidistat setpoints, determines if the zone requires humidification or dehumidification, and then passes this single load to the equipment for the single setpoint humidistat case. This value is not multiplied by zone or group multipliers.</p>
<h4 id="zone-predicted-moisture-load-to-humidifying-setpoint-moisture-transfer-rate-kgwaters">Zone Predicted Moisture Load to Humidifying Setpoint Moisture Transfer Rate [kgWater/s]</h4>

This is calculated and reported from the Predict step in the Zone Predictor-Corrector module.

This value is multiplied by zone or group multipliers.</p>
<h4 id="zone-predicted-moisture-load-to-dehumidifying-setpoint-moisture-transfer-rate-kgwaters">Zone Predicted Moisture Load to Dehumidifying Setpoint Moisture Transfer Rate [kgWater/s]</h4>

<h3 id="zonecontrolthermostatthermalcomfort">ZoneControl:Thermostat:ThermalComfort</h3>
<p>The thermal comfort zone control provides a method to control a zone to a dry-bulb temperature setpoint based on a thermal comfort model (e.g. Fanger) and a user-specified thermal comfort setpoint schedule.</p>
<p>This object references a control type schedule and one or more thermal comfort control type objects which in turn reference one or more setpoint schedules. The example at the end of this section illustrates a complete zone thermal comfort control specification including the control type and setpoint schedules. The control type schedule and the list of control type/name pairs are directly related. The schedule defines the type of control that is to be used during for each hour. Valid Control Types are</p>
<p>0 – Uncontrolled (No thermal comfort control)</p>
<p>1 - Single Thermal Comfort Heating Setpoint:Fanger</p>
<p>2 - Single Thermal Comfort Cooling Setpoint:Fanger</p>
<p>3 - Single Thermal Comfort Heating Cooling Setpoint:Fanger</p>
<p>4 - Dual Thermal Comfort Setpoint with Deadband:Fanger</p>
<p>Thus, if the schedule referenced in the ZoneControl:Thermostat:ThermalComfort statement has a value of 4 for a particular hour, this indicates that during that hour "Dual Thermal Comfort Setpoint with Deadband:Fanger" is to be used. The specific "Dual Thermal Comfort Setpoint with Deadband:Fanger " control object to be used is specified in the list of control type/name pairs. Then the specific control type objects reference the thermal comfort control setpoint schedule to be used. Because only one control can be specified for each control type in a ZoneControl:Thermostat:ThermalComfort statement, there are only four pairs possible in a particular ZoneControl:Thermostat:ThermalComfort type/name list. This is because individual controls can be defined hourly, thus giving the user a full range of flexibility. Since putting in the name of the control type directly in the schedule would be very cumbersome, the control types are assigned a number which is used in the hourly schedule profile.</p>
<p>The ZoneControl:Thermostat:ThermalComfort object can be used alone, or with a ZoneControl:Thermostat object. When both control objects co-exist for a specific zone and the thermal comfort control type value in the thermal comfort control type schedule is non-zero the thermal comfort object will override the value from the zone thermostat object. If the thermal comfort control is specified as “Uncontrolled” (thermal comfort control type value of 0) for a particular period, then control will revert to thermostat control if specified. If the thermal comfort control is specified as “Uncontrolled” for a particular period and thermostat control is not specified in the input, then conditions will float.</p>
<p>This object currently allows only Fanger comfort control (Ref. Thermal Comfort in Engineering Reference). It requires one or more people objects in a specific zone. It also requires inputs of Fields <em>Activity Level Schedule Name, Work Efficiency Schedule Name, Clothing Insulation Schedule Name</em> and <em>Air Velocity Schedule Name</em> in the people object(s). When thermal comfort control is used in a zone, the air velocity entered in the Air Velocity Schedule (Ref. People) should be greater than or equal to 0.1 and less than or equal to 0.5 m/s. A warning message will be issued if thermal comfort control is active and the air velocity is outside this range.</p>
<p>This object reads input PMV values from a given PMV setpoint schedule to calculate a dry-bulb temperature setpoint based on the selected thermal comfort model. The dry-bulb temperature setpoint calculation uses zone air humidity ratio at the previous system timestep and surface temperatures at the previous zone timestep, along with other conditions at the current timestep (e.g., activity level, clothing level and air velocity from the PEOPLE object).</p>
<h4 id="field-name_7">Field: Name</h4>

<h4 id="field-zone-or-zonelist-name_2">Field: Zone or ZoneList Name</h4>
<p>Name of the zone or set of zones that is being controlled. When the ZoneList option is used then this thermostat definition is applied to each of the zones in the zone list effecting a global definition for thermostatic control in the zone.</p>
<h4 id="field-averaging-method">Field: Averaging Method</h4>
<p>This choice field specifies the method for calculating the thermal comfort dry-bulb temperature setpoint for a zone with multiple People objects defined. The available choices are: <strong>SpecificObject</strong>, <strong>ObjectAverage</strong>, and <strong>PeopleAverage</strong>. This field is only used when multiple people objects are defined for this zone. If this field is specified as <strong>PeopleAverage</strong> and the total number of people for all people objects is zero for a particular timestep, the PeopleAverage method cannot be applied and the program automatically uses the ObjectAverage method for this timestep. The default input is <strong>PeopleAverage</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="field-object-name-for-specific-object-averaging-method">Field: Object Name for Specific Object Averaging Method</h4>
<p>This choice field specifies the name of the specific People object to be used for calculating comfort control when multiple People objects are defined. Only used if the Averaging Method is specified as “SpecificObject.”</p>
<h4 id="field-minimum-dry-bulb-temperature-setpoint">Field: Minimum Dry-Bulb Temperature Setpoint</h4>
<p>This field specifies the minimum dry-bulb temperature setpoint allowed for this zone. If the dry-bulb temperature calculated by the thermal comfort setpoint model is below this value, then the temperature setpoint will be set to this value. The default value is 0 ˚C.</p>

<p>The syntax for the current set (4) of zone thermal comfort control types is given below. In each case, the keyword is accompanied by an identifying name and either one or two schedule names (depending on whether the control type is a single or dual setpoint control). The schedule defines a Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) setpoint for the control type. The schedule would be defined through the standard schedule syntax described earlier in this document. For an uncontrolled thermal comfort zone, no Fanger thermal comfort object is specified or necessary.  However, the <code>Fanger thermal comfort output variables, Zone Thermal Comfort Fanger Model PMV and Zone Thermal Comfort Fanger Model PPD, are reported for thermal comfort uncontrolled conditions as well (e.i., free floating thermal comfort condition) just like a free floating temperature and humidity ratio.  These are indicative of the actual thermal comfort level in uncontrolled thermal comfort zone, and are outputs variables under</code>People objects<code>.</code></p>

<h3 id="zonecontrolcontaminantcontroller">ZoneControl:ContaminantController</h3>
<p>The ZoneControl:ContaminantController object is used for any of the following two purposes based on the system outdoor air method specified in the Controller:MechanicalVentilation.</p>
<p>1)   To control a zone to a specified indoor level of contaminants. When this zone is served by an AirLoopHVAC, the other zones served by the same AirLoopHVAC will have the same specified indoor level, if no objects in the other zones served by the same AirLoop are specified. Currently, the available contaminant controls are carbon dioxide and generic contaminant controls. The specified carbon dioxide setpoint is used to calculate the required outdoor airflow rate through the HVAC system to reach the setpoint. The AirLoopHVAC system outdoor flow rate is realized by the Controller:MechanicalVentilation object with System Outdoor Air Method = IndoorAirQualityProcedure.The specified generic contaminant setpoint is used to calculate the required outdoor airflow rate through the HVAC system to reach the setpoint. The AirLoopHVAC system outdoor flow rate is realized by the Controller:MechanicalVentilation object with System Outdoor Air Method = IndoorAirQualityProcedure-GenericContaminant.</p>
<p>2)   To specify minimum CO2 concentration schedule name for a zone. The AirLoopHVAC system outdoor flow rate is realized by the Controller:MechanicalVentilation object with System Outdoor Air Method = ProportionalControl. “Carbon Dioxide Control Availability Schedule Name” determines the availability of “ProportionalControl”.</p>
<p>For the first purpose above, when multiple zones are served by an AirLoop, those zones that do not have a contaminant controller object specified in the input data file are automatically assigned a carbon dioxide setpoint. Zone objects entered in the input data file are internally assigned an index number from 1 to n (first defined Zone object = 1, next Zone object defined in the input file = 2, etc.). For zones served by an AirLoop that do not have a contaminant controller specified, the zone’s carbon dioxide setpoint will be the same as the zone with the next highest zone index number that has a contaminant controller specified. If a zone with a higher index number and contaminant controller specified does not exist, then the zone with the next lowest zone  index number that has a contaminant controller specified will be used. For example, assume an AirLoop serves zones 1 through 5, but one ZoneControl:ContaminantController object is specified for zone 2, a second ZoneControl:ContaminantController object is specified for zone 4, and no ZoneControl:ContaminantController objects are specified for zones 1, 3 and 5. In this case, zone 1 will be assigned the carbon dioxide setpoint schedule that was specified for zone 2, and zones 3 and 5 will be assigned the carbon dioxide setpoint schedule that was specified for zone 4.</p>

<h2 id="group-air-path">Group -- Air Path</h2>
<h3 id="airloophvacsupplypath-airloophvacreturnpath">AirLoopHVAC:SupplyPath, AirLoopHVAC:ReturnPath</h3>
<p>The zone supply and return air paths are used to describe the configuration of the flow path that the supply air takes in moving from the main air handler to the zone terminal units and that the return air takes on leaving the zones and returning to the central return air duct. The air paths consist of a group of components – AirLoopHVAC:ZoneSplitters and AirLoopHVAC:SupplyPlenums for the supply path and AirLoopHVAC:ReturnPlenums and AirLoopHVAC:ZoneMixers for the return path. The connectivity of the paths is established by the components’ node connections. There are no branches defined in the zone air path constructs.</p>
<p>For a typical single duct air system there will be one AirLoopHVAC:SupplyPath and one AirLoopHVAC:ReturnPath. A typical dual duct system would have 2 AirLoopHVAC:SupplyPaths – one for the hot air and one for the cold air – and 1 AirLoopHVAC:ReturnPath.</p>
<p>The AirLoopHVAC:SupplyPlenum component provides the capability to have supply air distributed to the conditioned zones through one or more plenum zones such as would occur in an underfloor air distribution system (UFAD). The AirLoopHVAC:ReturnPlenum component allows the program to model return air plenums. Of course plenums are always optional. The simplest AirLoopHVAC:SupplyPath would consist of only an AirLoopHVAC:ZoneSplitter; similarly the simplest return air path consists of a single AirLoopHVAC:ZoneMixer. A UFAD system supply air path might consist of a single AirLoopHVAC:ZoneSplitter connecting to multiple AirLoopHVAC:SupplyPlenums which in turn could each supply one or more conditioned zones. A system with return plenums would have an AirLoopHVAC:ReturnPath in which the conditioned zones connect to the return plenum inlets and the return plenum’s outlets connect to a single AirLoopHVAC:ZoneMixer.</p>
<p>Both the zone supply and return plenums are solved in the heat balance as thermal zones which couple through heat conduction with adjacent zones. Since they are solved as thermal zones the solution scheme involves the zone predictor-corrector technique which will lag the temperature at the system timestep in every zone. See Summary of Predictor-Corrector Procedure in the EnergyPlus Engineering Reference.</p>
<p>Below are the descriptions of the zone supply and return path statements. Note that each statement type has an identifying name, a single inlet/outlet node name, and a list of component type/name pairs. For a single zone being served by an air loop, the inlet to its air distribution unit and the zone return air outlet can be the zone equipment inlet and outlet nodes directly, thus eliminating the need to specify an AirLoopHVAC:SupplyPath and an AirLoopHVAC:ReturnPath.</p>

<p>The AirLoopHVAC:SupplyPath lists one or more AirLoopHVAC:ZoneSplitter and AirLoopHVAC:SupplyPlenum components comprising the path.

<p>The simple building shown in the figure below consists of a controlled zone and a return plenum zone that is used for the return air. This simple configuration contains a ground floor controlled zone with a window and a return plenum zone which handles the roof load. The return air plenum is a special type of component since there is both a heat balance connection and building description and a system airflow connection that transfers the airflow directly from the controlled zone to the return plenum zone in the system air simulation. The input described in this section is mainly just for the system airflow connections in the HVAC algorithms. In addition the return plenum zone must be fully input as a zone object for the heat balance calculation. The zone description needs to contain the wall descriptions - the interzone ceiling and floor, and for this simple case the roof. All the other attributes of a zone that can be specified in the building description can be used with a return plenum zone if necessary: scheduled loads, windows, etc.</p>

<p>Solar collectors are thermal devices that convert solar energy into thermal energy by raising the temperature of a circulating heat transfer fluid. The fluid can then be used to heat water for domestic hot water usage or space heating.</p>
<p>In EnergyPlus solar collectors are components that are connected to the plant loop. A solar heating system can be constructed with a combination of solar collectors, pumps, and hot water tanks.</p>
<p>Flate plate solar collectors are defined using two objects:  SolarCollector:FlatPlate:Water and SolarCollectorPerformance:FlatPlate. Similarly, Integral-Collector-Storage (ICS) solar collectors are defined using two objects: SolarCollector:IntegralCollectorStorage, and SolarCollectorPerformance:IntegralCollectorStorage.  The SolarCollector:FlatPlate:Water and SolarCollector:IntegralCollectorStorage objects describe the plant component connections. These object also reference  SolarCollectorPerformance:FlatPlate and SolarCollectorPerformance:IntegralCollectorStorage performance objects which contains the thermal and optical performance test data for a specific make and model of collector. Parameters are defined separately so that these values can be organized into a reference data set and need only be entered once if for an array of the same type of collectors.</p>

<h3 id="solar-collector-heating-system-plant-connections">Solar Collector Heating System Plant Connections</h3>
<p>This section provides an overview of how to model solar heating systems.  A solar heating system can be constructed using a combination of solar collectors, pumps, water tanks and water heaters. The solar collector must be connected on the demand side of the plant loop. Multiple collector modules can be combined in series and parallel using the normal plant connection rules. The supply side of the plant loop should contain a water heater with the solar collector loop connecting to the <em>Source Side Inlet</em> and <em>Source Side Outlet</em> nodes. As usual, the pump must be the first component on the supply side.</p>
<p>If the solar heating system is for domestic hot water (or service water heating) usage only, the field <em>Use Flow Rate Fraction Schedule Name</em> of the WaterHeater:Mixed object can be used to avoid additional plant connections. If the system has more complicated hot water requirements or if the system is for space heating, the <em>Use Side Inlet</em> and <em>Use Side Outlet</em> nodes must be connected to another plant loop to serve zone and non-zone equipment. (See the WaterHeater:Mixed object documentation for more information.)</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../InputOutputReference/media/image339.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 132. Solar Collector Plant Loop Connection Diagram</p>
<p>NOTE:  The EnergyPlus plant simulation requires the pump to be the first component on the supply side. This may be different from the way the solar heating system is actually configured. This should not affect the validity of the simulation results.</p>
<p>In order to realize energy savings with a solar heating system, it is best to use a two-tank system with a storage tank and auxiliary water heater. The storage tank gathers heat directly from the solar collectors and stores it for later use. The storage tank is modeled using a WaterHeater:Mixed object with the <em>Heater Maximum Capacity</em> set to zero. The auxiliary water heater is positioned downstream of the storage tank on the supply side of the main plant loop. The auxiliary water heater, or booster water heater, provides additional heat if the storage tank water is not hot enough. The auxiliary water heater can be modeled as an instantaneous/tankless water heater or as a standard tanked water heater with heating source (see WaterHeater:Mixed).</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../InputOutputReference/media/image340.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 133. Two-Tank Solar Heating System Connection Diagram</p>
<p>Another strategy to consider for solar heating systems is to allow the storage tank to reach a much higher temperature than necessary for the end use. This allows the tank to store more energy from the solar collectors, when it is available. However, for applications such as domestic hot water, it is undesirable and unsafe to supply excessive hot water temperatures at the point of demand. To take advantage of higher storage temperatures, yet still avoid scalding temperatures at the faucet, the hot water leaving the storage tank can be tempered with cold water using a three-way valve to achieve the target temperature. See the TemperingValve object documentation for more details.</p>
<p>A complete two-tank solar heating system with tempering valve is shown below.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../InputOutputReference/media/image341.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 134. Two-Tank Solar Heating System with Tempering Valve</p>
<h3 id="solar-heating-system-control">Solar Heating System Control</h3>
<p>There are several options for controlling a solar heating system in EnergyPlus. Since the solar collectors request a constant flow demand based on their <em>Maximum Flow Rate</em>, the limiting factor is actually the flow rate determined by the loop pump. Therefore the entire system can be controlled using the <em>Pump Flow Rate Schedule</em> of the pump. If the schedule is omitted, the pump and system will run all the time (without any other controls specified). This is usually not the best way to operate a solar heating system.</p>
<p>To better control the collector loop, a differential thermostat can be used to compare the temperature in the water heater to the temperature in the collector so that the pump is only turned on when there is a useful heat gain. The differential thermostat is simulated using the AvailabilityManager:DifferentialThermostat object. For a typical system, the <em>Hot Node Name</em> field refers to an outlet node of one of the collector modules. The <em>Cold Node Name</em> field refers to the <em>Source Side Outlet</em> node, i.e. the cold storage water leaving the water heater. The fields <em>Temperature Difference On Limit</em> and <em>Temperature Difference Off Limit</em> are usually 8 –12 C and 1 – 3 C respectively. If the two temperature differences are too close, it is possible for the system to turn on and off rapidly without much useful heat gain. This can also occur if the flow rate through the collector is too high. Without flow the fluid in the collector heats up more quickly; when high flow is turned on, all of the hot fluid is removed and the temperature drops, forcing the system off again.</p>
<p>Another control method is to use a photovoltaic panel to power the pump. The system begins pumping when there is enough solar radiation to operate the pump. This is not yet implemented in EnergyPlus.</p>
<h4 id="freeze-prevention">Freeze Prevention</h4>
<p>In climates with a cold season, the solar heating system must be designed to avoid the risk of fluid freezing in the solar collector or exposed pipes and causing damage. This is not a problem if air is the heat transfer fluid. With water, however, there are several strategies that can minimize the risk.</p>
<p><em>Seasonal schedule</em>. The simplest strategy is to not use the system during the cold season. This is a hassle because it requires the collector to be manually drained of all fluid. The benefits of the solar heating system are also lost during this time. This can be simulated in EnergyPlus with the appropriate pump schedule for the collector system.</p>
<p><em>Antifreeze</em>. The freezing point of the liquid is decreased by adding antifreeze to the water or using a different heat transfer liquid with a lower freezing point. This cannot yet be simulated in EnergyPlus because only pure water is currently allowed in plant loops.</p>
<p><em>Drain-back system</em>. This strategy automatically empties the collector when the pump is not running. This scenario is modeled by default in EnergyPlus, although the extra pump energy required to start the system is not taken into account.</p>
<p><em>Recirculation system</em>. This strategy automatically recirculates warm liquid from the storage tank back through the collector to maintain the system above the freezing point. There are system losses using this method. This can be simulated in EnergyPlus by using AvailabilityManager:LowTemperatureTurnOn to force the system to turn on when the outdoor air temperature or collector outlet temperature falls below a specified minimum.</p>
<h4 id="additional-controls">Additional Controls</h4>
<p>In addition to freeze prevention, it is also necessary to prevent the system from becoming too hot. This is usually a safety issue for the water heater. For this case it is important to have a high temperature cutoff to stop the pump before damaging the water heater. This is accomplished with a AvailabilityManager:HighTemperatureTurnOff.</p>
<h4 id="system-availability-manager-list-example">System Availability Manager List Example</h4>
<p>To use the availability managers for the control cases described above, a AvailabilityManagerAssignmentList must be defined and referenced in the PlantLoop object of the collector loop. An example of a differential thermostat, recirculation for freeze prevention, and high temperature cutoff is shown below:</p>

<h3 id="solarcollectorunglazedtranspired">SolarCollector:UnglazedTranspired</h3>
<p>This object is used to model unglazed transpired solar collectors (UTSC) used to condition outdoor air. These collectors are generally used to heat air drawn through perforated absorbers that are heated by the sun and also recover heat conducted out through the underlying wall. The SolarCollector:UnglazedTranspired****object represents a single collector attached to one or more BuildingSurface:Detailed objects and to one or more outdoor air systems. Therefore the transpired collector is part of both the thermal envelope and the HVAC system. An example file is provided called TranspiredCollectors.idf.</p>
<p>The area and orientation of the collector is obtained from BuildingSurface:Detailed objects, which are referenced by name. Although the collector surface itself is slightly detached from the underlying building wall (or roof), no additional surface object is needed to represent the collector itself. When modeling transpired collectors, it is important to consider the size of the collector when developing the building model’s BuildingSurface:Detailed objects because the underlying surfaces must match the collector. For example, if the collector covers only part of the wall, then that wall should be split into separate surfaces where one matches the size of the collector. A single collector can be associated with as many BuildingSurface:Detailed objects as desired (although if you need to use more than 10 surfaces, then the IDD will need to be extended). The collector can be arranged at any tilt angle by describing the surfaces appropriately. The surfaces need not be contiguous nor have the same orientation, but the program will issue warnings if surfaces have widely ranging tilts and azimuths.</p>
<p>The collector conditions outdoor air and is connected to the outdoor air system using the usual method of specifying node names. Using the UTSC model requires specifying a relatively complete HVAC air system that includes an outdoor air path. This will typically require using a set of objects that, at a minimum, will include:  AirLoopHVAC:ControllerList, AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem:EquipmentList, AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem, OutdoorAir:NodeList, OutdoorAir:Mixer, SetpointManager:MixedAir, and Controller:OutdoorAir. A single UTSC can serve more than one outdoor air system but requires also using a separate object, called SolarCollector:UnglazedTranspired:MultiSystem to specify node connections.</p>
<p>Controls for the UTSC involve setting the rate of air flow and the status of a bypass damper. If the bypass damper is open, then all the ventilation air goes straight into the outdoor air mixer; if it closed, then all the air first passes through the UTSC. The bypass damper is modeled as completely open or completely closed. The UTSC bypass damper control is determined by an availability manager, the airflow set by the outdoor air mixer controls, and thermostatic type controls that decide if heating is useful. An availability schedule is used to bypass the collector for certain times of the year, eg. summer cooling season. The air flow rates are set by controls associated with the outdoor air mixer (see SetpointManager:MixedAir, and Controller:OutdoorAir). Thermostatic type control decides if the collector will provide useful heating based on either of two types of setpoints. The first type of temperature setpoint is managed by SetpointManager:MixedAir, where the UTSC model looks at a control node, usually the mixed air node. The second type is an extra setpoint especially for free heating that is managed within this object where the UTSC model looks at the zone air node.</p>
<h4 id="field-name_26">Field: Name</h4>
<p>This field contains a unique name for the unglazed transpired solar collector.</p>
<h4 id="field-boundary-conditions-model-name">Field: Boundary Conditions Model Name</h4>
<p>This field contains the name of a SurfaceProperty:OtherSideConditionsModel object declared elsewhere in the input file. This will connect the collector to the exterior boundary conditions for the underlying heat transfer surface.</p>
<h4 id="field-availability-schedule-name">Field: Availability Schedule Name</h4>
<p>This field contains the name of a schedule that determines whether or not the UTSC is available. When the schedule value is less than or equal to zero, the UTSC is always bypassed. When the schedule value is greater than zero, the UTSC is available and will be used when other conditions are met, such as outdoor air requested by mixer and preheating has been determined to be beneficial based on thermostatic control. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.</p>
<h4 id="field-inlet-node-name_5">Field: Inlet Node Name</h4>
<p>This field contains the name of an air node that provides air into the UTSC. This node name should also be assigned to be an outdoor air node using the OutdoorAir:NodeList or OutdoorAir:Node objects. This node should also be named as the actuated node in a Controller:OutdoorAir object. If the UTSC is connected to more than one air system, then this field can be left blank and the SolarCollector:UnglazedTranspired:MultiSystem object should be used to define the nodes.</p>
<h4 id="field-outlet-node-name_5">Field: Outlet Node Name</h4>
<p>This field contains the name of an air node that is the outlet of the UTSC. This node name will typically be the inlet to the OutdoorAir:Mixer (if there is no other equipment on the outdoor air path). If the UTSC is connected to more than one air system, then this field can be left blank and the SolarCollector:UnglazedTranspired:MultiSystem object should be used to define the nodes.</p>
<h4 id="field-setpoint-node-name">Field: Setpoint Node Name</h4>
<p>This field contains the name of an air node that has a setpoint manager controlling its temperature setpoint. This node name will typically be named as the control node in a a Controller:OutdoorAir object. If the UTSC is connected to more than one air system, then this field can be left blank and the SolarCollector:UnglazedTranspired:MultiSystem object should be used to define the nodes.</p>
<h4 id="field-zone-node-name_2">Field: Zone Node Name</h4>
<p>This field contains the name of an air node for a thermal zone that is ultimately connected to the air system. This node is used with the setpoint schedule, defined in the following field, to provide an added layer of thermostatic control for the UTSC without affecting the control of auxiliary heating. If there is a single air system that is connected to more than one zone, then a single zone should be selected based on where the thermostat might be located. If the UTSC is connected to more than one air system, then this field can be left blank and the SolarCollector:UnglazedTranspired:MultiSystem object should be used to define the nodes.</p>
<h4 id="field-free-heating-setpoint-schedule-name">Field: Free Heating Setpoint Schedule Name</h4>
<p>This field contains the name of a temperature schedule defined elsewhere in the input file. This schedule should define temperatures <em>desired</em> in the zone, but not necessarily <em>required</em>. This secondary setpoint schedule is used to allow the UTSC to operate as if it has its own thermostat that is separate from the primary control mechanism. When the UTSC is used with auxiliary heating, the usual setpoint managers and temperature controllers will determine how the auxiliary heaters are controlled. This allows using a higher zone air temperature setpoint for controlling UTSC bypass than for the auxiliary heating system.</p>
<h4 id="field-diameter-of-perforations-in-collector">Field: Diameter of Perforations in Collector</h4>
<p>This field is used to enter the effective diameter of the perforations in the collector surface. The diameter should be entered in meters. For perforations other than round, use an equivalent diameter for a round hole that would have the same area.</p>
<h4 id="field-distance-between-perforations-in-collector">Field: Distance Between Perforations in Collector</h4>
<p>This field is used to enter the pitch, or average, shortest distance between perforations.</p>
<h4 id="field-thermal-emissivity-of-collector-surface">Field: Thermal Emissivity of Collector Surface</h4>
<p>This field is used to enter the thermal emissivity of the collector. This surface property is for longwave infrared radiation. The property is used for both sides of collector. Most painted materials have an emissivity of 0.9.</p>
<h4 id="field-solar-absorbtivity-of-collector-surface">Field: Solar Absorbtivity of Collector Surface</h4>
<p>This field is used to enter the solar absorbtivity of the collector. This surface property is for shortwave, solar radiation. The property is used for the front side of the collector that faces the environment. Darker colors have a higher absorbtivity. While black is the highest performance, other colors might be used to match the color scheme of the rest of the facade. The following table provides sample solar absorbtivities for different colors (source:  Conserval Engineering Inc., Toronto, Ontario, Canada).</p>

<h4 id="field-effective-overall-height-of-collector">Field: Effective Overall Height of Collector</h4>
<p>This field is used to enter a nominal height for the collector. This value is used in the program to determine a length scale in the vertical direction for the buoyancy-driven portion of natural ventilation that occurs when the collector is inactive. (Note that most of the geometry information is obtained from the underlying surfaces.)  The value entered here is adjusted inside the program to account for tilt of the collector. While the value here would generally correspond to the actual distance/height, its value is not critical and it can be used to adjust modeling the air exchange rates in passive mode. If the collector is horizontal, then the length scale is obtained from the following field.</p>
<h4 id="field-effective-gap-thickness-of-plenum-behind-collector">Field: Effective Gap Thickness of Plenum Behind Collector</h4>
<p>This field is used to enter a nominal gap thickness for the collector. This distance value is only used when the collector is near horizontal to determine a length scale in the vertical direction for buoyancy calculations. For example, if the collector is mounted on a flat roof, its tilt-adjusted height is zero and the program will use this gap thickness as a length scale rather than the height from the previous field.</p>
<h4 id="field-effective-cross-section-area-of-plenum-behind-collector">Field: Effective Cross Section Area of Plenum Behind Collector</h4>
<p>This field is used to enter the nominal cross sectional area of the gap behind the collector. This area is used to determine a velocity scale for surface convection heat transfer correlations when the collector is active. This value is generally the average gap thickness times the average width of the collector.</p>
<h4 id="field-hole-layout-pattern-for-pitch">Field: Hole Layout Pattern for Pitch</h4>
<p>This field is used to describe the pattern of perforations in the collector surface. There are currently two choices available:  Square and Triangle. Note that the hole layout pattern should be consistent with how the value for pitch was determined.</p>
<h4 id="field-heat-exchange-effectiveness-correlation">Field: Heat Exchange Effectiveness Correlation</h4>
<p>This field is used to select which correlation is used to model heat transfer from the collector surface to the incoming air when the collector is active. There are two choices available:  Kutscher1994, and VanDeckerHollandsBrunger2001. See the Engineering Reference for details and references.</p>
<h4 id="field-ratio-of-actual-collector-surface-area-to-projected-surface-area">Field: Ratio of Actual Collector Surface Area to Projected Surface Area</h4>
<p>This field is used to enter a factor that accounts for the extra surface area resulting from corrugations in the collector surface. Corrugations help stiffen the collector. The projected surface area is obtained by the program from the (flat) underlying surfaces. If the collector is flat then this ratio is 1.0. If the collector is corrugated, then this ratio will be greater than one. A typical value might be 1.165.</p>
<h4 id="field-roughness-of-collector">Field: Roughness of Collector</h4>
<p>This field is used to describe the relative roughness of the collector material. This field is similar to one in the Material object. This parameter only influences the convection coefficients, more specifically the outside convection coefficient. A special keyword is expected in this field with the options being “VeryRough”, “Rough”, “MediumRough”, “MediumSmooth”, “Smooth”, and “VerySmooth” in order of roughest to smoothest options.</p>
<h4 id="field-collector-thickness">Field: Collector Thickness</h4>
<p>This field is used to enter the thickness of the collector material. This value is only needed for the Van Decker Hollands Brunger 2001 correlation. The material thickness should be entered in meters.</p>
<h4 id="field-effectiveness-for-perforations-with-respect-to-wind">Field: Effectiveness for Perforations with Respect to Wind</h4>
<p>This field is used to enter a value for the coefficient used to determine natural air exchanges from wind, or Cv. When the collector is inactive, wind will cause exterior air to move in and out of the collector. Cv is an arbitrary coefficient used to model the effectiveness of openings and depends on opening geometry and the orientation with respect to the wind. Cv should probably be in the range 0.25 to 0.65. Increasing Cv will increase the amount of natural ventilation.</p>
<h4 id="field-discharge-coefficient-for-openings-with-respect-to-buoyancy-driven-flow">Field: Discharge Coefficient for Openings with Respect to Buoyancy Driven Flow</h4>
<p>This field is used to enter a value for the coefficient used to determine natural air exchanges from buoyancy, or Cd. When the collector is inactive, stack or buoyancy effects will cause exterior air to move in and out of the collector. Cd is an arbitrary discharge coefficient that depends on the geometry of the opening. Cd should probably be in the range 0.4 to 1.0. Increasing Cd will increase the amount of natural ventilation.</p>
<h4 id="field-surface-35-name">Field: Surface &lt;#&gt; Name</h4>
<p>The remaining fields are used to name the BuildingSurface:Detailed objects that are associated with the UTSC. These are the underlying heat transfer surfaces and are defined elsewhere in the input file. These other surfaces should all specify OtherSideConditionsModel as their exterior environment. The input object can currently accommodate up to ten surfaces, but it is extensible.</p>

<p>This field contains the minimum volumetric flow rate while operating in variable flow capacity rate in cubic meters per second.</p>
<h4 id="field-pump-control-type">Field: Pump Control Type</h4>
<p>This is a choice field of Continuous or Intermittent. A variable speed pump is defined with maximum and minimum flow rates that are the physical limits of the device. If there is no load on the loop and the pump is operating intermittently, then the pump can shutdown. For any other condition such as the loop having a load and the pump is operating intermittently or the pump is continuously operating (regardless of the loading condition), the pump will operate and select a flow somewhere between the minimum and maximum limits. In these cases where the pump is running, it will try to meet the flow request made by demand side components. Applicable availability managers (ref. AvailabilityManagerAssignmentList) may override this control by forcing the pump to be on or off.</p>
<h4 id="field-pump-flow-rate-schedule-name">Field: Pump Flow Rate Schedule Name</h4>
<p>The schedule values modify the value for Rated Flow Rate of the pump on a time basis. The default is that the pump is ON and runs according to its other operational requirements specified above. This schedule is for special, not typical pump operations.</p>
<h4 id="field-pump-curve-name">Field: Pump Curve Name</h4>
<p>This references a pump curve to be used during pump flow-loop head resolution.  This is only applicable for loop simulations which include pressure components on at least a single branch.  More information regarding pressure system simulation is available in the engineering reference.</p>

<h4 id="field-vfd-control-type">Field: VFD Control Type</h4>
<p>This string defines which type of VFD control type to perform.  PressureSetPointControl is a realistic approach which requires inputs of pressure range schedules to control the pump rpm to maintain a certain pressure drop (head).  ManualControl is an idealized control strategy in which the pump RPM is maintained at a scheduled value throughout the simulation, abiding by other flow restrictions in the loop.</p>
<h4 id="field-pump-rpm-schedule-name">Field: Pump RPM Schedule Name</h4>

<h4 id="field-minimum-pressure-schedule">Field: Minimum Pressure Schedule</h4>
<p>For VFD Control Type = PressureSetPointControl, this field defines the minimum pressure range setpoint value, or the lower bound of pressure drop (head) to use when determining the required pump speed.  For VFD Control Type = ManualControl, this field is not interpreted.  The value of the schedule is Pascals.</p>
<h4 id="field-maximum-pressure-schedule">Field: Maximum Pressure Schedule</h4>
<p>For VFD Control Type = PressureSetPointControl, this field defines the maximum pressure range setpoint value, or the upper bound of pressure drop (head) to use when determining the required pump speed.  For VFD Control Type = ManualControl, this field is not interpreted.  The value of the schedule is Pascals.</p>

<h4 id="field-zone-name_3">Field: Zone Name</h4>
<p>This field is optional. It can be used to input the name of the Zone in which the pump is located in the model.  If the pump is outdoors, or skin losses are not to be modeled, then leave this field blank.  If a valid Zone name is entered, then the portion of electrical power consumed by the pump that is not added to the working fluid is added to the surrounding Zone.</p>
<h4 id="field-skin-loss-radiative-fraction">Field: Skin Loss Radiative Fraction</h4>
<p>This field is optional.  If a Zone is named in the previous field and pump losses are to be added to a surrounding thermal zone, then this input determines the split between thermal radiation and thermal convection for the heat losses from the pump.  If it is left blank then all the losses will be convective. </p>

<p>This numeric field contains the pump’s rated power consumption in Watts.  If the user is performing a pressure simulation on the loop in which this pump is found, this value would only be used to estimate pump efficiency.  During reported calculations, the pump would use the loop pressure drop and current flow conditions along with efficiency to calculate pump power dynamically.</p>

<p>This numeric field contains the pump’s fraction of power loss to the fluid.</p>
<h4 id="field-pump-control-type_1">Field: Pump Control Type</h4>
<p>This is a choice field of Continuous or Intermittent. The operation of a constant speed pump is fairly straightforward. If the user designates a constant speed pump that is operating continuously, the pump will run regardless of whether or not there is a load. This may have the net effect of adding heat to the loop if no equipment is turned on. If the pump is constant speed and operates intermittently, the pump will run at its capacity if a load is sensed and will shut off if there is no load on the loop. Applicable availability managers (ref. AvailabilityManagerAssignmentList) may override this control by forcing the pump to be on or off.</p>
<h4 id="field-pump-flow-rate-schedule-name_1">Field: Pump Flow Rate Schedule Name</h4>
<p>The schedule values modify the Rated Flow Rate of the pump on a time basis. The default is that the pump is ON and runs according to its other operational requirements specified above. This schedule is for special, not typical pump operations.</p>
<h4 id="fieldpump-curve-name">Field:Pump Curve Name</h4>
<p>This field is only used if the user is performing a pressure-based simulation in the plantloop of the “LoopFlowCorrection” type (see PlantLoop section for how to enable this).</p>
<p>This field references a separate pressure head curve that the user has input separately in the input file.  The pressure curve represents a non-dimensional regression of pressure-flow rate data.  The equation should be of the following form:</p>
<div>\[\psi  = {C_4} \times {\varphi ^4} + {C_3} \times {\varphi ^3} + {C_2} \times {\varphi ^2} + {C_1} \times \varphi  + {C_0}.\]</div>

<p>In this equation, the two dimensionless parameters, X and X are defined in terms of physical pump and flow parameters as:</p>
<div>\[\psi  = \frac{{\Delta P}}{{\rho {N^2}{D^2}}}\]</div>

<div>\[\varphi  = \frac{{\dot m}}{{\rho N{D^3}}}\]</div>

<p>Where “Delta P” is the pressure drop, mdot is the fluid mass flow rate, rho is a representative fluid density, N is the rotational speed of the pump, and D is the pump impeller diameter.</p>
<p>Since the user may not need a full fourth order expansion of this, the user may use linear (first order), quadratic (second order), cubic (third order), or full quartic (fourth order).  These are available in the objects Curve:Linear, Curve:Quadratic, Curve:Cubic, Curve:Quartic.</p>
<p>Once this curve is input properly (along with the following two fields), the pump will respond to the plant loop pressure drop when resolving the flow rate.  Note that this simulation method will likely result in a plant loop that does not exactly hit the setpoint as the current simulation method does.  This is due to the loop flow rate now being “pressure-based” and not “decision-based”.</p>
<h4 id="fieldimpeller-diameter">Field:Impeller Diameter</h4>
<p>This field is only used if the user is performing a pressure-based simulation in the plantloop of the “LoopFlowCorrection” type (see PlantLoop section for how to enable this).</p>
<p>To “re-dimensionalize” the dimensionless pump curve, the impeller diameter must be known.  This value is entered in meters.</p>
<h4 id="fieldrotational-speed">Field:Rotational Speed</h4>
<p>This field is only used if the user is performing a pressure-based simulation in the plantloop of the “LoopFlowCorrection” type (see PlantLoop section for how to enable this).</p>
<p>To “re-dimensionalize” the dimensionless pump curve, the rotational speed must be known.  This value is entered in RPM (revolutions per minute).</p>
<h4 id="field-zone-name_4">Field: Zone Name</h4>
<p>This field is optional. It can be used to input the name of the Zone in which the pump is located in the model.  If the pump is outdoors, or skin losses are not to be modeled, then leave this field blank.  If a valid Zone name is entered, then the portion of electrical power consumed by the pump that is not added to the working fluid is added to the surrounding Zone.</p>
<h4 id="field-skin-loss-radiative-fraction_1">Field: Skin Loss Radiative Fraction</h4>
<p>This field is optional.  If a Zone is named in the previous field and pump losses are to be added to a surrounding thermal zone, then this input determines the split between thermal radiation and thermal convection for the heat losses from the pump.  If it is left blank then all the losses will be convective. </p>

<h2 id="group-heating-and-cooling-coils">Group – Heating and Cooling Coils</h2>
<p>Several different coils may be added to zone equipment and air loops. This includes simple heating (gas, electric, and hot water) and a simple water-cooling coil as well as a more detailed flat fin water-cooling coil model. In general, the heating coil description can be used for a heating coil, a reheat coil, or a preheat coil in the air loop simulation or for zone equipment. Figure 135 is an example of a heating and cooling coil in the air loop simulation in a dual duct system. This does show the basic node structure that will be referenced in the input description. The figure does show water coils since they are the most complex to input in the simulation compared to the Electric and Gas coils which only have air connections.</p>

<h3 id="coilcoolingwater">Coil:Cooling:Water</h3>
<p>The water cooling coil (Coil:Cooling:Water) has the ability to give detailed output with simplified inputs, inputting complicated coil geometry is not required by the user for this model instead the coil is sized in terms of auto-sizeable thermodynamic inputs. The coil requires thermodynamic inputs such as temperatures, mass flow rates and humidity ratios.</p>
<p>The coil is sized using auto-sized/user design input conditions and the UA values are calculated from the design conditions. A rough estimate of the coil area is provided along with percentage of surface wet and/or dry. This model uses the NTU-effectiveness approach to model heat transfer and has two types of flow arrangements cross-flow or counter-flow.</p>
<p>The basic underlying idea is - use auto sizable thermodynamic design inputs, calculate the coil UA’s, use these UA values and operating conditions from the nodes connections, calculate the outlet stream conditions, and calculate the heat transfer rates.</p>

<h3 id="coilheatingdesuperheater">Coil:Heating:Desuperheater</h3>
<p>A simplified approach is used to determine the performance of this air heating coil. The model assumes that the heating energy provided by this coil is reclaimed from the superheated refrigerant gas leaving a compressor (i.e., a desuperheating refrigerant-to-air heating coil) and does not impact the performance of the compressor. This coil can be used in air loop simulations but can’t be used by certain compound objects (e.g., AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:AirToAir, AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:WaterToAir, or Dehumidifier:Desiccant:NoFans) or any air distribution equipment (e.g., AirTerminal:SingleDuct:ConstantVolume:Reheat, AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:Reheat, or AirTerminal:SingleDuct:SeriesPIU:Reheat).</p>
<p>The desuperheater heating coil input requires a coil name, an availability schedule, and a heat reclaim recovery efficiency. The reclaim recovery efficiency determines the amount of heat available for use by this heating coil. Approximately 25-30% of the energy rejected by typical refrigeration system condensers is to reduce the superheated refrigerant vapor temperature to the condensing temperature. Recovery efficiencies higher than 30% may cause the refrigerant gas to condense which in turn impacts the performance of the refrigeration system. For this reason, the maximum heat reclaim recovery efficiency for this coil is 30% for most sources of waste heat, including refrigeration compressor racks. The one exception to this 30% limit is a condenser that is part of a detailed refrigeration system. In a detailed refrigeration system, the portion of the rejected heat that lies within the superheated region is explicitly calculated. Therefore, the desuperheater coils supplied by a condenser attached to a detailed refrigeration system are subject to a maximum reclaim recovery efficiency of 90% of the heat within the superheated region.</p>
<p>The next two input items for the desuperheater heating coil are the node names for the inlet and outlet air streams. The following two input fields define the source of heating energy for the coil. This desuperheater heating coil may only be used with direct expansion (DX) cooling or refrigeration equipment. The first of these two inputs is the heating source object type while the second defines the name of the heating source. For proper modeling, the desuperheater heating coil must be placed downstream of a DX cooling coil when reclaiming heat from that cooling coil. Desuperheating heating coil placement is unrestricted when reclaiming heat from a  Refrigeration:CompressorRack  or Refrigeration:Condenser.</p>
<p>The next input field is optional and defines the set point node name if the desuperheater heating coil is to be controlled based on temperature. When a load-based control scheme is used, this field is left blank. A final optional input is used to model parasitic electric energy use of auxiliary equipment associated with the desuperheater heating coil (e.g., solenoid valve).</p>

<h4 id="field-availability-schedule-name_1">Field: Availability Schedule Name</h4>
<p>This alpha field defines the name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the desuperheater heating coil can run during a given time period. Schedule values must range from 0 to 1. A schedule value greater than 0 indicates that the coil can operate during the time period. A value equal to 0 denotes that the coil must be off for that time period. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.</p>
<h4 id="field-heat-reclaim-recovery-efficiency">Field: Heat Reclaim Recovery Efficiency</h4>
<p>This numeric field defines the ratio of recovered waste heat from the superheated refrigerant gas to the total rejected waste heat from the heating source (as if no heat reclaim occurred). Values can range from 0.0 up to a maximum of 0.9 if the source is a refrigeration condenser and 0.3 for all other waste heat sources. If this input field is left blank, the default value is 0.8 for a refrigeration condenser source type and 0.25 for all other sources.</p>
<h4 id="field-air-inlet-node-name_6">Field: Air Inlet Node Name</h4>

<h4 id="field-air-outlet-node-name_6">Field: Air Outlet Node Name</h4>
<p>This alpha field defines the name of the HVAC system node to which the desuperheater heating coil sends its outlet air.</p>
<h4 id="field-heating-source-object-type">Field: Heating Source Object Type</h4>
<p>This alpha field defines the source of superheated refrigerant gas from which the desuperheater heating coil recovers energy. Valid choices are:</p>
<p>Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed</p>
<p>Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoSpeed</p>

<p>Refrigeration:Condenser:AirCooled</p>
<p>Refrigeration:Condenser:EvaporativeCooled</p>
<p>Refrigeration:Condenser:WaterCooled</p>
<p>When the heating coil source is a DX Coil, the air loop’s supply air fan control mode may be auto fan (cycling fan cycling coil), constant fan, or variable volume. When the heating source is a compressor rack for refrigerated cases or a refrigeration condenser, the supply air fan control mode should be either variable volume or constant fan.</p>
<p>NOTE: Use of the desuperheater heating coil in variable air volume systems should be done with caution since the model assumption of a fixed heat reclaim recovery efficiency may not be valid if the air flow rate over the coil varies significantly.</p>
<h4 id="field-heating-source-name">Field: Heating Source Name</h4>
<p>This alpha field defines the name of the desuperheater heating coil source (e.g., the name of a specific valid coil (as mentioned in the previous field) which provides waste heat to this desuperheater heating coil).</p>
<p>NOTE: When the heating source is a  Refrigeration Compressor rack, the heat rejection location in the Refrigeration:CompressorRack object must be “Outdoors”. If the compressor rack heat rejection location is “Zone”, the total amount of heat rejection available for reclaim (e.g., by this desuperheater heating coil) is set to zero by the compressor rack object and the simulation proceeds.</p>
<h4 id="field-temperature-setpoint-node-name_3">Field: Temperature Setpoint Node Name</h4>
<p>This optional alpha field defines the name of the HVAC system node used for temperature-based control (e.g., controlling the heating coil’s outlet air dry-bulb temperature to a setpoint). If the desuperheater heating coil is temperature controlled through the use of a Set Point Manager, then the control node specified in the Set Point Manager will be entered here. If the desuperheater heating coil is controlled based on a certain heating load to be met (e.g., using this heating coil as part of AirLoopHVAC:Unitary:Furnace:HeatCool for high humidity control), this field should be left blank.</p>
<h4 id="field-parasitic-electric-load">Field: Parasitic Electric Load</h4>
<p>This optional numeric field defines the parasitic electric load (in Watts) due to control valves or other devices specific to the desuperheater heating coil. The load is applied whenever the coil is heating the air. The model assumes that this electric load is small and does not contribute to heating the air.</p>

For this reason, an adaptation of the single-speed DX cooling coil model is used to model the variable-speed compression system used in VRF AC systems. The model inputs are quite similar to the input requirements for the single-speed DX cooling coil model, however, the location of a majority of the inputs have been moved to the variable refrigerant flow air conditioner object since multiple DX cooling coils will use the same DX compression system (Ref.

<p>This alpha field defines the cooling capacity ratio modifier as a function of indoor wet-bulb temperature or indoor wet-bulb and outdoor dry-bulb temperatures. This curve is a linear, quadratic, or cubic curve if the cooling capacity is soley a function of indoor wet-bulb temperature (i.e., the indoor terminal units weighted average inlet air wet-bulb temperatures). Without specific manufacturers data indicating otherwise, the use of a single independent variable is recommended for this coil type. If, however, the user has reason to believe the cooling capacity is both a function of indoor wet-bulb temperature and outdoor dry-bulb temperature (and has manufacturers data to create the performance curve), a bi-quadratic equation using weighted average indoor wet-bulb temperature and condenser entering air dry-bulb temperature as the independent variables may be used.

<h3 id="coilheatingdxvariablerefrigerantflow">Coil:Heating:DX:VariableRefrigerantFlow</h3>
<p>The variable refrigerant flow (VRF) DX heating coil model uses performance information at rated conditions along with performance curves for variations in total capacity, energy input ratio and part load fraction to determine performance at part-load conditions. The impacts of defrost operation is modeled based a combination of user inputs and empirical models taken from the air-to-air heat pump algorithms in DOE-2.1E.</p>
<p>The VRF DX heating coil input requires an availability schedule, the gross rated heating capacity and the rated air volume flow rate. The rated air volume flow rate should be between 0.00008056 m<sup>3</sup>/s and 0.00002684 m<sup>3</sup>/s per watt of gross rated heating capacity.</p>
<p>Two performance curves are required. The first performance curve defines the heating capacity as a function of indoor air dry-bulb and outdoor condenser entering air wet-bulb temperature. This curve object is specified in the variable refrigerant flow air-to-air heat pump object. The second performance curve is specific the each VRF DX heating coil and defines the change in heating capacity as a function of air flow fraction. Each of these performance curves are further discussed here.</p>
<p>1)   Heating capacity modifier curve (function of temperature, specified in Heat Pump)</p>
<p>The heating capacity modifier curve (function of temperature) can be a function of both the outdoor wet-bulb temperature and indoor air dry-bulb temperature. Users have the choice of a bi-quadratic curve with two independent variables or a tri-quadratic curve with three independent variable. The tri-quadratic curve is recommended if sufficient manufacturer data is available as it provides sensitivity to the combined total capacity of all indoor units connected to the heat pump condenser and a more realistic output. The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated heating capacity to give the gross heating capacity at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at an outdoor or indoor air temperature different from the rating point temperature) and the combination ratio of the installed system.</p>
<p>2)   Heating capacity modifier curve (function of flow fraction, specified in DX coil)</p>
<p>The heating capacity modifier curve (function of flow fraction) is a quadratic or cubic curve with the independent variable being the ratio of the actual air flow rate across the heating coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated heating capacity and the heating capacity modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the gross heating capacity at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the coil is operating.</p>

<p>The gas heating coil is a simple capacity model with a user inputted gas burner efficiency. The default for the gas burner efficiency is 80%. This coil will be simpler than shown in Figure 135 since it will only have air nodes to connect it in the system. The coil can be used in the air loop simulation or in the zone equipment as a reheat coil. Depending on where it is used determines if this coil is temperature or capacity controlled. If used in the air loop simulation it will be controlled to a specified temperature scheduled from the Setpoint Manager.

<h4 id="field-parasitic-electric-load_1">Field: Parasitic Electric Load</h4>
<p>This is the parasitic electric load associated with the gas coil operation, such as an inducer fan, etc.. This will be modified by the PLR (or coil runtime fraction if a part-load fraction correlation is provided in the next input field) to reflect the time of operation in a simulation timestep.</p>
<h4 id="field-part-load-fraction-correlation-curve-name">Field: Part Load Fraction Correlation Curve Name</h4>
<p>This alpha field defines the name of a quadratic or cubic performance curve (Ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of gas consumption rate by the heating coil as a function of the part load ratio (PLR, sensible heating load/nominal capacity of the heating coil). For any simulation timestep, the nominal gas consumption rate (heating load/burner efficiency) is divided by the part-load fraction (PLF) if a part-load curve has been defined. The part-load curve accounts for efficiency losses due to transient coil operation.</p>
<p>The part-load fraction correlation should be normalized to a value of 1.0 when the part load ratio equals 1.0 (i.e., no efficiency losses when the heating coil runs continuously for the simulation timestep). For PLR values between 0 and 1 ( 0 &lt;= PLR &lt; 1), the following rules apply:</p>
<p>PLF &gt;= 0.7   and   PLF &gt;= PLR</p>
<p>If PLF &lt; 0.7 a warning message is issued, the program resets the PLF value to 0.7, and the simulation proceeds. The runtime fraction of the heating coil is defined a PLR/PLF. If PLF &lt; PLR, then a warning message is issues and the runtime fraction of the coil is limited to 1.0.</p>
<p>A typical part load fraction correlation for a conventional gas heating coil (e.g., residential furnace) would be:</p>
<p>PLF = 0.8 + 0.2(PLR)</p>
<h4 id="field-parasitic-gas-load">Field: Parasitic Gas Load</h4>

<h3 id="coilheatinggasmultistage">Coil:Heating:Gas:MultiStage</h3>
<p>The multi stage gas heating coil is a simple capacity model with a user inputted gas burner efficiencies at different stages. This coil will only have air nodes to connect it in the system. The coil can be used in the air loop simulation or in the zone equipment as a reheat coil. Depending on where it is used determines if this coil is temperature or capacity controlled. If used in the air loop simulation it will be controlled to a specified temperature scheduled from the Setpoint Manager. If it is used in zone equipment, it will be controlled from the zone thermostat by meeting the zone demand. For the time being, this coil model can only be called by the parent object AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:AirToAir:MultiSpeed.</p>
<h4 id="field-name_40">Field: Name</h4>
<p>A unique identifying name for each coil.</p>
<h4 id="field-availability-schedule-name_5">Field: Availability Schedule Name</h4>
<p>Schedule that defines when the coil is available. If the schedule’s value is 0.0, then the coil is not available and flow will not be requested. If the schedule’s value is &gt; 0.0 (usually 1 is used), the coil is available. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods. Schedule values must be &gt;= 0 and &lt;= 1.</p>

<h4 id="field-temperature-setpoint-node-name_5">Field: Temperature Setpoint Node Name</h4>
<p>If the coil is used in the air loop simulation and is temperature controlled using a Set Point Manager, then the node that is the control node needs to be specified here. If the coil is used in an air terminal unit, the coil is load controlled and a control node set point is not required. At present, the multistage gas heating coil does not model temperature setoint control.</p>
<h4 id="field-part-load-fraction-correlation-curve-name_1">Field: Part Load Fraction Correlation Curve Name</h4>
<p>This alpha field defines the name of a quadratic or cubic performance curve (Ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of gas consumption rate by the heating coil as a function of the part load ratio (PLR, sensible heating load/nominal capacity of the heating coil). For any simulation timestep, the nominal gas consumption rate (heating load/burner efficiency) is divided by the part-load fraction (PLF) if a part-load curve has been defined. The part-load curve accounts for efficiency losses due to transient coil operation.</p>
<p>The part-load fraction correlation should be normalized to a value of 1.0 when the part load ratio equals 1.0 (i.e., no efficiency losses when the heating coil runs continuously for the simulation timestep). For PLR values between 0 and 1 ( 0 &lt;= PLR &lt; 1), the following rules apply:</p>
<p>PLF &gt;= 0.7   and   PLF &gt;= PLR</p>
<p>If PLF &lt; 0.7 a warning message is issued, the program resets the PLF value to 0.7, and the simulation proceeds. The runtime fraction of the heating coil is defined a PLR/PLF. If PLF &lt; PLR, then a warning message is issues and the runtime fraction of the coil is limited to 1.0.</p>
<p>A typical part load fraction correlation for a conventional gas heating coil (e.g., residential furnace) would be:</p>
<p>PLF = 0.8 + 0.2(PLR)</p>

<p>This detailed flat fin coil model is for continuous plate fins. First, found in Type 12 from MODSIM, but now programmed directly from Elmahdy, A.H. and Mitalas, G.P.

<p>This DX cooling coil input requires an availability schedule, the gross rated total cooling capacity, the gross rated SHR, the gross rated COP, and the rated air volume flow rate. The latter 4 inputs determine the coil performance at the rating point (air entering the cooling coil at 26.7°C drybulb/19.4°C wetbulb and air entering the outdoor condenser coil at 35°C drybulb/23.9°C wetbulb). The rated air volume flow rate should be between .00004027 m<sup>3</sup>/s and .00006041 m<sup>3</sup>/s per watt of gross rated total cooling capacity (300 to 450 cfm/ton).</p>
<p>The rated volumetric air flow to total cooling capacity ratio for 100% dedicated outdoor air (DOAS) application DX cooling coils should be between 0.00001677 (m3/s)/W (125 cfm/ton) and 0.00003355 (m3/s)/W (250 cfm/ton).</p>
<p>Pumped refrigerant economizer integrated with the single speed DX cooling coil model will use exactly the same model except that performance curves use lookup table to cover the pumped refrigerant economizer and the compressor operating ranges. One or two independent variables may used to represent the performance data.</p>
<p>This model requires 5 curves as follows:</p>
<p>1.    The total cooling capacity modifier curve (function of temperature) is a curve with two independent variables: wet-bulb temperature of the air entering the cooling coil, and dry-bulb temperature of the air entering the air-cooled condenser coil (wet-bulb temperature if modeling an evaporative-cooled condenser). The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated total cooling capacity to give the gross total cooling capacity at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the rating point temperatures).  This curve is typically a biquadratic but any curve or table with two independent variables can be used.</p>
<p>2.    The total cooling capacity modifier curve (function of flow fraction) is a curve or lookup table with the independent variable being the ratio of the actual air flow rate across the cooling coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated total cooling capacity and the total cooling capacity modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the gross total cooling capacity at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the coil is operating.  This curve is typically a quadratic or cubic but any curve or table with one independent variables can be used.</p>
<p>3.    The energy input ratio (EIR) modifier curve (function of temperature) is a curve with two independent variables: wet-bulb temperature of the air entering the cooling coil, and dry-bulb temperature of the air entering the air-cooled condenser coil (wet-bulb temperature if modeling an evaporative-cooled condenser). The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR (inverse of the rated COP) to give the EIR at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the rating point temperatures).  This curve is typically a biquadratic but any curve or table with two independent variables can be used.</p>
<p>4.    The energy input ratio (EIR) modifier curve (function of flow fraction) is a curve or lookup table with the independent variable being the ratio of the actual air flow rate across the cooling coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR (inverse of the rated COP) and the EIR modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the EIR at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the coil is operating.  This curve is typically a quadratic or cubic but any curve or table with one independent variables can be used.</p>
<p>5.    The part load fraction correlation (function of part load ratio) is a curve or a lookup table with the independent variable being part load ratio (sensible cooling load / steady-state sensible cooling capacity). The output of this curve is used in combination with the rated EIR and EIR modifier curves to give the “effective” EIR for a given simulation timestep. The part load fraction (PLF) correlation accounts for efficiency losses due to compressor cycling. The curve should be normalized to a value of 1.0 when the part-load ratio equals 1.0 (i.e., the compressor(s) run continuously for the simulation timestep).  This curve is typically a quadratic or cubic but any curve or table with one independent variables can be used.</p>
<p>The curves are simply specified by name. Curve inputs are described in the curve manager section of this document (see Performance Curves in this document).</p>
<p>The next four input fields are optional and relate to the degradation of latent cooling capacity when the supply air fan operates continuously while the cooling coil/compressor cycle on and off to meet the cooling load. The fan operating mode is determined in the partent object and is considered to either be constant (e.g. CoilSystem:Cooling:DX) or can be scheduled (e.g. AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool). When scheduled, the schedule value must be greater than 0 to calculate degradation of latent cooling capacity. At times when the parent object’s supply air fan operating mode schedule is 0, latent degradation will be ignored. When modeling latent capacity degradation, these next four input fields must all have positive values.</p>
<p>The next input specifies the outdoor air node used to define the conditions of the air entering the outdoor condenser. If this field is left blank, the outdoor temperature entering the condenser is taken directly from the weather data. If this field is not blank, the node name specified must be listed in an OutdoorAir:Node object where the height of the node is taken into consideration when calculating outdoor temperature from the weather data. Alternately, the node name must be specified in an OutdoorAir:NodeList object where the outdoor temperature entering the condenser is taken directly from the weather data.</p>
<p>The next input describes the type of outdoor condenser coil used with the DX cooling coil (Air Cooled or Evap Cooled). The following three inputs are required when modeling an evaporative-cooled condenser: evaporative condenser effectiveness, evaporative condenser air volume flow rate, and the power consumed by the evaporative condenser pump. Crankcase heater capacity and cutout temperature are entered in the next two input fields. These two fields for this object define the name of the water storage tank for supply and condensate collection. See section “DX Cooling Coil Model” in the EnergyPlus Engineering Document for further details regarding this model.</p>
<p>The last two input fields following the Basin Heater Operating Schedule Name are the Sensible Heat Ratio (SHR) modifier cruve names for temperature and flow fraction.  These two input fields  are optional and used only when a user intends to override SHR calculated using the apparatus dew point (ADP) and bypass factor (BF) method.  See section “SHR Calculation Using User Specified SHR Modifier Curves” in the EnergyPlus Engineering Document for further details.</p>

<p>The name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the DX cooling coil can run during a given time period. A schedule value greater than 0 (usually 1 is used) indicates that the unit can be on during a given time period.

Capacity should be “gross” (i.e., the effect of supply air fan heat is NOT accounted for). When used in a heat pump, the gross rated total cooling capacity should be within 20% of the gross rated heating capacity, otherwise a warning message is issued.</p>
<h4 id="field-gross-rated-sensible-heat-ratio">Field: Gross Rated Sensible Heat Ratio</h4>

Both the sensible and total cooling capacities used to define the Rated SHR should be “gross” (i.e., the effect of supply air fan heat is NOT accounted for).</p>
<h4 id="field-gross-rated-cooling-cop">Field: Gross Rated Cooling COP</h4>
<p>The coefficient of performance is the ratio of the gross total cooling capacity in watts to electrical power input in watts of the DX cooling coil unit at rated conditions (air entering the cooling coil at 26.7°C drybulb/19.4°C wetbulb, air entering the outdoor condenser coil at 35°C drybulb/ 23.9°C wetbulb, and a cooling coil air flow rate defined by field “rated air flow rate” below). The input power includes electric power for the compressor(s) and condenser fan(s) but does not include the power consumption of the supply air fan. The gross COP should NOT account for the supply air fan. If this input field is left blank, the default value is 3.0.</p>
<h4 id="field-rated-air-flow-rate_2">Field: Rated Air Flow Rate</h4>

<p>This field is the electric power for the evaporator (cooling coil) fan per air volume flow rate through the coil at the rated conditions in W/(m<sup>3</sup>/s). The default value is 773.3 W/(m<sup>3</sup>/s) (365 W/1000 cfm) if this field is left blank. If a value is entered, it must be &gt;= 0.0 and &lt;= 1250 W/(m<sup>3</sup>/s). This value is only used to calculate Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (SEER), Energy Efficiency Ratio (EER), Integrated Energy Efficiency Ratio (IEER) and the Standard Rating (Net) Cooling Capacity which will be outputs in the EnergyPlus eio file (ref. EnergyPlus Engineering Reference, Single Speed DX Cooling Coil, Standard Ratings). This value is not used for modeling the evaporator (cooling coil) fan during simulations; instead, it is used for calculating SEER, EER, IEER and Standard Rating Cooling Capacity to assist the user in verifying their inputs for modeling this type of equipment.</p>

<p>The name of a performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the gross total cooling capacity as a function of the wet-bulb temperature of the air entering the cooling coil, and the dry-bulb temperature of the air entering the air-cooled condenser coil (wet-bulb temperature if modeling an evaporative-cooled condenser). The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated total cooling capacity to give the gross total cooling capacity at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the rating point temperatures). The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 at the rating point.  This curve is typically a biquadratic but any curve or table with two independent variables can be used.</p>
<h4 id="field-total-cooling-capacity-function-of-flow-fraction-curve-name">Field: Total Cooling Capacity Function of Flow Fraction Curve Name</h4>
<p>The name of a quadratic or cubic performance curve (ref:  Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the gross total cooling capacity as a function of the ratio of actual air flow rate across the cooling coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated total cooling capacity and the total cooling capacity modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the gross total cooling capacity at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the coil is operating. The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate.</p>
<h4 id="field-energy-input-ratio-function-of-temperature-curve-name">Field: Energy Input Ratio Function of Temperature Curve Name</h4>
<p>The name of a performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input ratio (EIR) as a function of the wet-bulb temperature of the air entering the cooling coil, and the dry-bulb temperature of the air entering the air-cooled condenser coil (wet-bulb temperature if modeling an evaporative-cooled condenser). The EIR is the inverse of the COP. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR (inverse of rated COP) to give the EIR at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the rating point temperatures). The curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 at the rating point.  This curve is typically a biquadratic but any curve or table with two independent variables can be used.</p>
<h4 id="field-energy-input-ratio-function-of-flow-fraction-curve-name">Field: Energy Input Ratio Function of Flow Fraction Curve Name</h4>
<p>The name of a performance curve (Ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input ratio (EIR) as a function of the ratio of actual air flow rate across the cooling coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The EIR is the inverse of the COP. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR and the EIR modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the EIR at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the cooling coil is operating. This curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate.  This curve is typically a quadratic or cubic but any curve or table with one independent variables can be used.</p>
<h4 id="field-part-load-fraction-correlation-curve-name_2">Field: Part Load Fraction Correlation Curve Name</h4>
<p>This alpha field defines the name of a performance curve (Ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of electrical power input to the DX unit as a function of the part load ratio (PLR, sensible cooling load/steady-state sensible cooling capacity). The product of the rated EIR and EIR modifier curves is divided by the output of this curve to give the “effective” EIR for a given simulation timestep. The part load fraction (PLF) correlation accounts for efficiency losses due to compressor cycling.  This curve is typically a quadratic or cubic but any curve or table with one independent variables can be used.</p>
<p>The part load fraction correlation should be normalized to a value of 1.0 when the part load ratio equals 1.0 (i.e., no efficiency losses when the compressor(s) run continuously for the simulation timestep). For PLR values between 0 and 1 (0 &lt;= PLR &lt; 1), the following rules apply:</p>
<p>PLF &gt;= 0.7   and   PLF &gt;= PLR</p>
<p>If PLF &lt; 0.7 a warning message is issued, the program resets the PLF value to 0.7, and the simulation proceeds. The runtime fraction of the coil is defined as PLR/PLF. If PLF &lt; PLR, then a warning message is issued and the runtime fraction of the coil is limited to 1.0.</p>
<p>A typical part load fraction correlation for a conventional, single-speed DX cooling coil (e.g., residential unit) would be:</p>
<p>PLF = 0.85 + 0.15(PLR)</p>
<p>If the user wishes to model no efficiency degradation due to compressor cycling, the part load fraction correlation should be defined as follows:</p>
<p>PLF = 1.0 + 0.0(PLR)</p>
<h4 id="field-nominal-time-for-condensate-removal-to-begin">Field: Nominal Time for Condensate Removal to Begin</h4>

Nominal time is equal to the ratio of the energy of the coil's maximum condensate holding capacity (J) to the coil's steady-state latent capacity (W). Suggested value is 1000; zero value means the latent degradation model is disabled. The default value for this field is zero. The supply air fan operating mode must be continuous (i.e., the supply air fan operating mode may be specified in other ”parent” objects and is assumed continuous in some objects (e.g., CoilSystem:Cooling:DX) or can be scheduled in other objects [e.g., AirloopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool]), and this field as well as the next three input fields for this object must have positive values in order to model latent capacity degradation.</p>

<p>Ratio of the initial moisture evaporation rate from the cooling coil (when the compressor first turns off, in Watts) and the coil's steady-state latent capacity (Watts) at rated airflow and temperature conditions.

The supply air fan operating mode must be continuous (i.e., the supply air fan operating mode may be specified in other ”parent” objects and is assumed continuous in some objects (e.g., CoilSystem:Cooling:DX) or can be scheduled in other objects [e.g., AirloopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool]); and this field, the previous field and the next two fields must have positive values in order to model latent capacity degradation.</p>
<h4 id="field-maximum-cycling-rate">Field: Maximum Cycling Rate</h4>
<p>The maximum on-off cycling rate for the compressor (cycles per hour), which occurs at 50% run time fraction. Suggested value is 3; zero value means latent degradation model is disabled. The default value for this field is zero. The supply air fan operating mode must be continuous (i.e., the supply air fan operating mode may be specified in other ”parent” objects and is assumed continuous in some objects (e.g., CoilSystem:Cooling:DX) or can be scheduled in other objects [e.g., AirloopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool]); and this field, the previous two fields and the next field must have positive values in order to model latent capacity degradation.</p>
<h4 id="field-latent-capacity-time-constant">Field: Latent Capacity Time Constant</h4>
<p>Time constant (in seconds) for the cooling coil's latent capacity to reach steady state after startup. Suggested value is 45: supply air fan operating mode must be continuous. That is, the supply air fan operating mode may be specified in other ”parent” objects and is assumed continuous in some objects (e.g., CoilSystem:Cooling:DX) or can be scheduled in other objects (e.g., AirloopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool), and this field as well as the previous three input fields for this object must have positive values in order to model latent capacity degradation.</p>
<h4 id="field-condenser-air-inlet-node-name">Field: Condenser Air Inlet Node Name</h4>
<p>This optional alpha field specifies the outdoor air node name used to define the conditions of the air entering the outdoor condenser. If this field is left blank, the outdoor air temperature entering the condenser (dry-bulb or wet-bulb) is taken directly from the weather data. If this field is not blank, the node name specified must also be specified in an OutdoorAir:Node object where the height of the node is taken into consideration when calculating outdoor air temperature from the weather data. Alternately, the node name may be specified in an OutdoorAir:NodeList object where the outdoor air temperature is taken directly from the weather data.</p>

<p>The type of condenser used by the DX cooling coil. Valid choices for this input field are <strong>AirCooled</strong> or <strong>EvaporativelyCooled</strong>. The default for this field is <strong>AirCooled</strong>.</p>

<p>The effectiveness of the evaporative condenser, which is used to determine the temperature of the air entering the outdoor condenser coil as follows:</p>
<div>\[Tcond\,inlet = \,\left( {Twb,o} \right)\,\, + \,\,\left( {1 - EvapCondEffectiveness} \right)\left( {Tdb,o\,\, - Twb,o} \right)\]</div>

<p>where</p>
<p><em>T<sub>cond\ inlet</sub></em> = the temperature of the air entering the condenser coil (C)</p>
<p><em>T<sub>wb,o</sub></em> = the wet-bulb temperature of the outdoor air (C)</p>
<p><em>T<sub>db,o</sub></em> = the dry-bulb temperature of the outdoor air (C)</p>
<p>The resulting condenser inlet air temperature is used by the Total Cooling Capacity Modifier Curve (function of temperature) and the Energy Input Ratio Modifier Curve (function of temperature). The default value for this field is 0.9, although valid entries can range from 0.0 to 1.0. This field is not used when Condenser Type = Air Cooled.</p>
<p>If the user wants to model an air-cooled condenser, they should simply specify AirCooled in the field Condenser Type. In this case, the Total Cooling Capacity Modifier Curve (function of temperature) and the Energy Input Ratio Modifier Curve (function of temperature) input fields for this object should reference performance curves that are a function of outdoor dry-bulb temperature.</p>
<p>If the user wishes to model an evaporative-cooled condenser AND they have performance curves that are a function of the wet-bulb temperature of air entering the condenser coil, then the user should specify Condenser Type = Evap Cooled and the evaporative condenser effectiveness value should be entered as 1.0. In this case, the Total Cooling Capacity Modifier Curve (function of temperature) and the Energy Input Ratio Modifier Curve (function of temperature) input fields for this object should reference performance curves that are a function of the wet-bulb temperature of air entering the condenser coil.</p>
<p>If the user wishes to model an air-cooled condenser that has evaporative media placed in front of it to cool the air entering the condenser coil, then the user should specify Condenser Type = Evap Cooled. The user must also enter the appropriate evaporative effectiveness for the media. In this case, the Total Cooling Capacity Modifier Curve (function of temperature) and the Energy Input Ratio Modifier Curve (function of temperature) input fields for this object should reference performance curves that are a function of outdoor dry-bulb temperature. Be aware that the evaporative media will significantly reduce the dry-bulb temperature of the air entering the condenser coil, so the Total Cooling Capacity and EIR Modifier Curves must be valid for the expected range of dry-bulb temperatures that will be entering the condenser coil.</p>
<h4 id="field-evaporative-condenser-air-flow-rate">Field: Evaporative Condenser Air Flow Rate</h4>
<p>The air volume flow rate, in m<sup>3</sup> per second, entering the evaporative condenser. This value is used to calculate the amount of water used to evaporatively cool the condenser inlet air. The minimum value for this field must be greater than zero, and this input field is autosizable (equivalent to 0.000144 m<sup>3</sup>/s per watt of rated total cooling capacity [850 cfm/ton]).

This field is not used when Condenser Type = Air Cooled.</p>
<h4 id="field-crankcase-heater-capacity">Field: Crankcase Heater Capacity</h4>
<p>This numeric field defines the crankcase heater capacity in Watts. When the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature is below the value specified in the input field “Maximum Outdoor Dry-bulb Temperature for Crankcase Heater Operation” (described below), the crankcase heater is enabled during the time that the compressor is not running. If this cooling coil is used as part of an air-to-air heat pump (Ref. AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:AirToAir or PackageTerminal: HeatPump:AirToAir), the crankcase heater defined for this DX cooling coil is ignored and the crankcase heater power defined for the DX heating coil (Ref. Coil:Heating:DX:SingleSpeed) is enabled during the time that the compressor is not running for either heating or cooling. The value for this input field must be greater than or equal to 0, and the default value is 0. To simulate a DX cooling coil without a crankcase heater, enter a value of 0.</p>
<h4 id="field-maximum-outdoor-dry-bulb-temperature-for-crankcase-heater-operation">Field: Maximum Outdoor Dry-Bulb Temperature for Crankcase Heater Operation</h4>

<h4 id="field-supply-water-storage-tank-name">Field: Supply Water Storage Tank Name</h4>
<p>This field is optional. It is used to describe where the coil obtains water used for evaporative cooling of its condenser. If blank or omitted, then the unit will obtain water directly from the mains. If the name of a Water Storage Tank object is used here, then the unit will obtain its water from that tank. If a tank is specified, the unit will attempt to obtain all the water it uses from the tank. However if the tank cannot provide all the water the condenser needs, then the unit will still operate and obtain the rest of the water it needs from the mains (referred to as StarvedWater).</p>
<h4 id="field-condensate-collection-water-storage-tank-name_2">Field: Condensate Collection Water Storage Tank Name</h4>
<p>This field is optional. It is used to describe where condensate from the coil is collected. If blank or omitted, then any coil condensate is discarded. Enter the name of Water Storage Tank object defined elsewhere and the condensate will then be collected in that tank.</p>
<h4 id="field-basin-heater-capacity">Field: Basin Heater Capacity</h4>
<p>This numeric field contains the capacity of the DX coil’s electric evaporative cooler basin heater in watts per degree Kelvin. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. This field is used in conjunction with the Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature described in the following field. The basin heater electric power is equal to this field multiplied by the difference between the basin heater set point temperature and the outdoor dry-bulb temperature. The basin heater only operates when the DX coil is off, regardless of the basin heater schedule described below. The basin heater capacity must be greater than or equal to zero, with a default value of zero if this field is left blank.</p>
<h4 id="field-basin-heater-setpoint-temperature">Field: Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature</h4>
<p>This numeric field contains the set point temperature (˚C) for the basin heater described in the previous field. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. The basin heater is active when the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature falls below this setpoint temperature, as long as the DX coil is off. This set point temperature must be greater than or equal to 2˚C, and the default value is 2˚C if this field is left blank.</p>
<h4 id="field-basin-heater-operating-schedule-name">Field: Basin Heater Operating Schedule Name</h4>
<p>This alpha field contains the name of the basin heater operating schedule. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. The basin heater operating schedule is assumed to be an on/off schedule and the heater is available to operate any time the schedule value is greater than 0. The basin heater operates when scheduled on and the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature is below the set point temperature described in the previous field. If this field is left blank, the basin heater is available to operate throughout the simulation. Regardless of this schedule, the basin heater may only operate when the DX coil is off.</p>
<h4 id="field-sensible-heat-ratio-function-of-temperature-curve-name">Field: Sensible Heat Ratio Function of Temperature Curve Name</h4>
<p>The name of a biquadratic normalized curve (Ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the sensible heat ratio (SHR) as a function of DX cooling coil entering air wet-bulb and dry-bulb temperatures.

This curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate. This input field is optional.</p>
<h4 id="field-zone-name-for-condenser-placement">Field: Zone Name for Condenser Placement</h4>
<p>This input field is name of a conditioned or unconditioned zone where the secondary coil (condenser) of DX system or a heat pump is to be placed.

<h3 id="coilcoolingdxtwospeed">Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoSpeed</h3>
<p>This component models a two-speed (or variable speed) DX compressor and fan. The method is based on the model used for the cycling, single speed DX unit. The single speed unit is described by single full load capacity, SHR, COP, and air flow rate at rated conditions. Off rated full load performance is obtained by the use of 4 modifier curves. At partial load the unit cycles on/off and the cycling losses are described by a part load fraction curve.</p>
<p>The multispeed unit is described by specifying the performance at two states: high speed compressor, high speed fan; and low speed compressor, low speed fan. When the unit load is above the high speed capacity, the unit runs with high speed compressor and fan. When the load on the unit is below the high speed capacity but above the low speed capacity, the unit will run with performance intermediate between high speed and low speed. When the load is less than the low speed capacity, the unit will cycle on/off just like the single speed unit.</p>
<p>The multispeed unit model requires 2 full sets of performance data. There must be a high and low speed capacity, SHR, COP, and evaporator air flow rate; as well as high and low speed performance curves – total cooling capacity modifier curve (function of temperature) and energy input ratio modifier curve (function of temperature).</p>
<p>The multispeed DX component should be used for all cases in which a DX VAV system is being simulated. Obviously this model – in which performance is obtained by interpolating between 2 specified states - is an oversimplification of how real multi-speed and variable speed DX cooling units are controlled. But detailed descriptions of how actual units perform and are controlled are not available. This model should give a good average prediction of multispeed and variable speed DX cooling unit performance. The last four input fields following the Basin Heater Operating Schedule Name are the Sensible Heat Ratio (SHR) modifier cruve names for temperature and flow fraction for high and low speed DX cooling coils.  These four input fields  are optional and used only when a user intends to override SHR calculated using the apparatus dew point (ADP) and bypass factor (BF) method.  See section “SHR Calculation Using User Specified SHR Modifier Curves” in the EnergyPlus Engineering Document for further details..</p>
<h4 id="field-name_43">Field: Name</h4>
<p>A unique user-assigned name for an instance of a multispeed DX cooling coil. Any reference to this DX coil by another object will use this name.</p>
<h4 id="field-availability-schedule-name_7">Field: Availability Schedule Name</h4>
<p>The name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the DX cooling coil can run during a given time period.

<h4 id="field-high-speed-rated-air-flow-rate">Field: High Speed Rated Air Flow Rate</h4>
<p>The high speed air volume flow rate, in m<sup>3</sup> per second, across the DX cooling coil at rated conditions. The rated air volume flow rate should be between 0.00004027 m<sup>3</sup>/s and 0.00006041 m<sup>3</sup>/s per watt of gross rated total cooling capacity.

If this field is used, then the internal static air pressure is used with the associated fan characteristics when calculating standard rated net capacity, EER, and IEER.  If this field is not used, then the standard ratings are still performed but use a default for specific fan power of 773.3 (W/(m<sup>3</sup>/s)).  The air pressure drop/rise input here should be “internal” in the sense that it is for the entire package of unitary equipment as it would be tested in a laboratory (including other non-cooling sections inside the package for filters, dampers, and.or heating coils) but none of the “external” pressure drop for distributing supply air throughout the building.  This is different from the input field called Pressure Rise in the fan object which includes both the external static pressure and the internal static pressure.  The results of standard rating calculations are reported to the EIO file and to predefined output tables called “DX Cooling Coils” and “VAV DX Cooling Standard Rating Details.”</p>

The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated total cooling capacity and the total cooling capacity modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the gross total cooling capacity at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the coil is operating. The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate. This curve is applied only at the high speed compressor, high speed fan operating point.

<h4 id="field-energy-input-ratio-function-of-flow-fraction-curve-name_1">Field: Energy Input Ratio Function of Flow Fraction Curve Name</h4>
<p>The name of a quadratic performance curve (Ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input ratio (EIR) as a function of the ratio of actual air flow rate across the cooling coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow).

<h4 id="field-part-load-fraction-correlation-curve-name_3">Field: Part Load Fraction Correlation Curve Name</h4>
<p>This alpha field defines the name of a quadratic or cubic performance curve (Ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of electrical power input to the DX unit as a function of the part load ratio (PLR, sensible cooling load/steady-state sensible cooling capacity). The product of the rated EIR and EIR modifier curves is divided by the output of this curve to give the “effective” EIR for a given simulation timestep. The part load fraction (PLF) correlation accounts for efficiency losses due to compressor cycling.</p>
<p>The part load fraction correlation should be normalized to a value of 1.0 when the part load ratio equals 1.0 (i.e., no efficiency losses when the compressor(s) run continuously for the simulation timestep). For PLR values between 0 and 1 (0 &lt;= PLR &lt; 1), the following rules apply:</p>
<p>PLF &gt;= 0.7   and   PLF &gt;= PLR</p>
<p>If PLF &lt; 0.7 a warning message is issued, the program resets the PLF value to 0.7, and the simulation proceeds. The runtime fraction of the coil is defined as PLR/PLF. If PLF &lt; PLR, then a warning message is issued and the runtime fraction of the coil is limited to 1.0.</p>
<p>A typical part load fraction correlation for a conventional, single-speed DX cooling coil (e.g., residential unit) would be:</p>
<p>PLF = 0.85 + 0.15(PLR)</p>
<p>If the user wishes to model no efficiency degradation due to compressor cycling, the part load fraction correlation should be defined as follows:</p>
<p>PLF = 1.0 + 0.0(PLR)</p>

<h3 id="coilcoolingdxtwostagewithhumiditycontrolmode">Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoStageWithHumidityControlMode</h3>
<p>The multimode DX coil is functionally equivalent to Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed but with multiple performance modes. It is capable of modeling two-stage DX units and units with an enhanced dehumidification mode such as coil bypass or subcool reheat. This object contains one-time specifications for the DX unit such as node names and crankcase heater specifications. It references one or more CoilPerformance:DX:Cooling objects which define the performance for each mode of operation. It can have up to 4 performance modes to accommodate a 2-stage 2-mode unit.</p>
<p>The multimode DX coil can be used only as a component of CoilSystem:Cooling:DX or AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool:VAVChangeoverBypass (parent object). These parent objects pass a load and dehumidification mode to this coil. If the coil has 2 capacity stages, the multimode coil model determines the stage sequencing.</p>
<h4 id="field-name_44">Field: Name</h4>
<p>A unique user-assigned name for an instance of a DX cooling coil. Any reference to this DX coil by another object will use this name.</p>
<h4 id="field-availability-schedule-name_8">Field: Availability Schedule Name</h4>
<p>The name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the DX cooling coil can run during a given time period. A schedule value greater than 0 (usually 1 is used) indicates that the unit can be on during a given time period. A value less than or equal to 0 (usually 0 is used) denotes that the unit must be off. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.</p>

When the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature is below the value specified in the input field “Maximum Outdoor Dry-bulb Temperature for Crankcase Heater Operation” (described below), the crankcase heater is enabled during the time that the compressor is not running. If this cooling coil is used as part of an air-to-air heat pump (Ref. AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool:VAVChangeoverBypass), the crankcase heater defined for this DX cooling coil is ignored and the crankcase heater power defined for the DX heating coil (Ref. Coil:Heating:DX:SingleSpeed) is enabled during the time that the compressor is not running for either heating or cooling. The value for this input field must be greater than or equal to 0, and the default value is 0. To simulate a DX cooling coil without a crankcase heater, enter a value of 0.</p>

<h4 id="field-number-of-capacity-stages">Field: Number of Capacity Stages</h4>
<p>This integer field defines the number of capacity stages. The value for this input field must be either 1 or 2, and the default value is 1. Larger DX units often have two capacity stages, which are often two completely independent compressor/coil circuits with the evaporator coils arranged in parallel in the supply air stream. 2-stage operation affects cycling losses and latent degradation due to re-evaporation of moisture with continuous fan operation.</p>
<h4 id="field-number-of-enhanced-dehumidification-modes">Field: Number of Enhanced Dehumidification Modes</h4>
<p>This integer field defines the number of enhanced dehumidification modes available. The value for this input field must be 0 or 1, and the default value is 0. If the DX unit can switch operating modes to increase dehumidification based on a humidistat signal, then set this to 1. This field just specified the availability of enhanced dehumidification. Actual control of the operating mode is handled by the coil's parent component.</p>

<h4 id="field-supply-water-storage-tank-name_2">Field: Supply Water Storage Tank Name</h4>
<p>This field is optional. It is used to describe where the coil obtains water used for evaporative cooling. If blank or omitted, then the cooler will obtain water directly from the mains. If the name of a Water Storage Tank object is used here, then the cooler will obtain its water from that tank. If a tank is specified, the coil will attempt to obtain all the water it uses from the tank. However if the tank cannot provide all the water the cooler needs, then the cooler will still operate and obtain the rest of the water it needs from the mains (referred to as StarvedWater).</p>
<h4 id="field-condensate-collection-water-storage-tank-name_4">Field: Condensate Collection Water Storage Tank Name</h4>
<p>This field is optional. It is used to describe where condensate from the coil is collected. If blank or omitted, then any coil condensate is discarded. Enter the name of Water Storage Tank object defined elsewhere and the condensate will then be collected in that tank.</p>
<h4 id="field-basin-heater-capacity_2">Field: Basin Heater Capacity</h4>
<p>This numeric field contains the capacity of the DX coil’s electric evaporative cooler basin heater in watts per degree Kelvin. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. This field is used in conjunction with the Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature described in the following field. The basin heater electric power is equal to this field multiplied by the difference between the basin heater set point temperature and the outdoor dry-bulb temperature.

This set point temperature must be greater than or equal to 2˚C, and the default value is 2˚C if this field is left blank.</p>
<h4 id="field-basin-heater-operating-schedule-name_2">Field: Basin Heater Operating Schedule Name</h4>
<p>This alpha field contains the name of the basin heater operating schedule. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. The basin heater operating schedule is assumed to be an on/off schedule and the heater is available to operate any time the schedule value is greater than 0. The basin heater operates when scheduled on and the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature is below the set point temperature described in the previous field.

<h3 id="coilcoolingdxmultispeed">Coil:Cooling:DX:MultiSpeed</h3>
<p>This component models a DX cooling unit with multiple discrete levels of cooling capacity. Depending on input choices, the user can model a single compressor with multiple operating speeds, or a unit with a single cooling coil fed by multiple compressors (e.g., row split or intertwined coil circuiting). Currently, this cooling coil can only be referenced by a AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:AirToAir:Multispeed object. Refer to Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoStageWithHumidityControlMode if the user wishes to model a cooling coil with discrete levels of cooling and the possibility of air bypass during low speed operation (e.g. face-split coil circuiting), or if cooling coil operation based on dehumidification requirements is desired.</p>
<p>The multispeed DX cooling coil can have from two to four operating speeds. When the coil operates at Speed 1 (the lowest speed), its performance is very similar to the single speed DX coil where the impacts of part-load ratio and latent capacity degradation can be included. When the coil operates at higher speeds (above Speed 1), the linear approximation methodology is applied. The coil outputs at two consecutive speeds are linearly interpolated to meet the required cooling capacity during an HVAC system timestep. When the coil performs above the lowest speed, the user can chose if they want to include part-load ratio and latent capacity degradation impacts at the higher speeds.</p>
<p>The multispeed unit is described by specifying the performance at different operating speeds. Each speed has its own set of input specifications: full load capacity, SHR, COP and air flow rate at rated conditions, along with modifier curves to determine performance when actual operating conditions are different from the rated conditions.</p>
<p>The coil operates to meet the sensible capacity being requested. When this requested capacity is above the sensible capacity of the highest operating speed, the coil runs continuously at the highest speed. When the requested capacity is between the sensible capacities of two consecutive speeds, the unit will operate a portion of the time at each speed to meet the request. When the requested capacity is less than the low speed (Speed 1) capacity, the unit will cycle on/off as needed.</p>
<h4 id="field-name_45">Field: Name</h4>
<p>A unique user-assigned name for an instance of a multispeed DX cooling coil. Any reference to this DX coil by another object will use this name.</p>
<h4 id="field-availability-schedule-name_9">Field: Availability Schedule Name</h4>
<p>The name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the DX cooling coil can run during a given time period. A schedule value greater than 0 (usually 1 is used) indicates that the unit can be on during the time period. A value less than or equal to 0 (usually 0 is used) denotes that the unit must be off for the time period. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.</p>
<h4 id="field-air-inlet-node-name_12">Field: Air Inlet Node Name</h4>
<p>The name of the HVAC system node from which the DX cooling coil draws its inlet air.</p>

<h4 id="field-condenser-air-inlet-node-name_2">Field: Condenser Air Inlet Node Name</h4>
<p>This optional alpha field specifies the outdoor air node name used to define the conditions of the air entering the outdoor condenser. If this field is left blank, the outdoor air temperature entering the condenser (dry-bulb or wet-bulb) is taken directly from the weather data. If this field is not blank, the node name specified must also be specified in an OutdoorAir:Node object where the height of the node is taken into consideration when calculating outdoor air temperature from the weather data. Alternately, the node name may be specified in an OutdoorAir:NodeList object where the outdoor air temperature is taken directly from the weather data.</p>

<h4 id="field-supply-water-storage-tank-name_3">Field: Supply Water Storage Tank Name</h4>
<p>This field is optional. It is used to describe where the coil obtains water used for evaporative cooling. If blank or omitted, then the evaporative cooler will obtain water directly from the mains. If the name of a Water Storage Tank object is used here, then the cooler will obtain its water from that tank. If a tank is specified, the coil will attempt to obtain all the water it uses from the tank. However if the tank cannot provide all the water the cooler needs, then the cooler will still operate and obtain the rest of the water it needs from the mains (referred to as StarvedWater).</p>
<h4 id="field-condensate-collection-water-storage-tank-name_5">Field: Condensate Collection Water Storage Tank Name</h4>
<p>This field is optional. It is used to describe where condensate from the coil is collected. If blank or omitted, then any coil condensate is discarded. Enter the name of Water Storage Tank object defined elsewhere and the condensate will then be collected in that tank.</p>
<h4 id="field-apply-part-load-fraction-to-speeds-greater-than-1">Field: Apply Part Load Fraction to Speeds Greater than 1</h4>
<p>This field determines whether part-load impacts on coil energy use are applied when the coil is operating at speeds greater than speed 1. The allowed choices are Yes or No, with the default being No if this field is left blank. Other input fields in this object allow the user to specify a part-load fraction correlation for each speed to account for compressor start up losses (cycle on/off). For the case of a single multi-speed compressor, the part load losses may only be significant when the compressor cycles between speed 1 and off, but the losses may be extremely small when the compressor operates between speed 1 and speed 2 (or between speeds 2 and 3, etc.). In this case, the user may chose to specify NO for this input field to neglect part-load impacts on energy use at higher operating speeds. If part-load impacts on coil energy use are thought to be significant (e.g., interwined cooling coil with multiple compressors feeding individual refrigerant circuits), then the user may chose to specify YES and the part-load fraction correlations specified for speeds 2 through 4 will be applied as appropriate. The selection for this input field does not affect part-load impacts when the compressor cycles between speed 1 and off  (i.e., the part-load fraction correlation for speed 1 is always applied).</p>
<h4 id="field-apply-latent-degradation-to-speeds-greater-than-1">Field: Apply Latent Degradation to Speeds Greater than 1</h4>
<p>This field determines whether latent capacity degradation is applied when the coil is operating at speeds greater than speed 1. The allowed choices are Yes or No, with the default being No if this field is left blank. Other input fields in this object allow the user to specify latent capacity degradation at each speed.</p>
<p>The latent capacity degradation model only applies when the ContinuousFanWithCyclingCompressor supply air fan operating mode is specified, to account for moisture evaporation from the wet cooling coil when the compressor cycles off but the supply air fan continues to operate. For the case of a single multi-speed compressor, latent capacity degradation may only be significant when the compressor cycles between speed 1 and off, but the losses may be extremely small when the compressor operates between speed 1 and speed 2 (or between speeds 2 and 3, etc.). In this case, the user may chose to specify NO for this input field to neglect latent capacity degradation impacts at higher operating speeds. If latent capacity degradation is thought to be significant (e.g., interwined or row-split cooling coil with multiple compressors feeding individual refrigerant circuits), then the user may chose to specify YES and the latent capacity degradation model will be applied for speeds 2 through 4 as appropriate. The selection for this input field does not affect latent capacity degradation between speed 1 and off.</p>
<h4 id="field-crankcase-heater-capacity_2">Field: Crankcase Heater Capacity</h4>
<p>This numeric field defines the crankcase heater capacity in Watts. When the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature is below the value specified in the input field “Maximum Outdoor Dry-bulb Temperature for Crankcase Heater Operation” (described below), the crankcase heater is enabled during the time that the compressor is not running. The value for this input field must be greater than or equal to 0. If this input field is left blank, the default value is 0. To simulate a unit without a crankcase heater, enter a value of 0.</p>
<h4 id="field-maximum-outdoor-dry-bulb-temperature-for-crankcase-heater-operation_2">Field: Maximum Outdoor Dry-Bulb Temperature for Crankcase Heater Operation</h4>
<p>This numeric field defines the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature above which the compressor’s crankcase heater is disabled. The value for this input field must be greater than or equal to 0.0°C. If this input field is left blank, the default value is 10°C.</p>
<h4 id="field-basin-heater-capacity_3">Field: Basin Heater Capacity</h4>
<p>This numeric field contains the capacity of the DX coil’s electric evaporative cooler basin heater in watts per degree Kelvin. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. This field is used in conjunction with the Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature described in the following field. The basin heater electric power is equal to this field multiplied by the difference between the basin heater set point temperature and the outdoor dry-bulb temperature. The basin heater only operates when the DX coil is off, regardless of the basin heater schedule described below. The basin heater capacity must be greater than or equal to zero, with a default value of zero if this field is left blank.</p>
<h4 id="field-basin-heater-setpoint-temperature_3">Field: Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature</h4>
<p>This numeric field contains the set point temperature (˚C) for the basin heater described in the previous field. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. The basin heater is active when the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature falls below this setpoint temperature, as long as the DX coil is off. This set point temperature must be greater than or equal to 2˚C, and the default value is 2˚C if this field is left blank.</p>
<h4 id="field-basin-heater-operating-schedule-name_3">Field: Basin Heater Operating Schedule Name</h4>
<p>This alpha field contains the name of the basin heater operating schedule. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. The basin heater operating schedule is assumed to be an on/off schedule and the heater is available to operate any time the schedule value is greater than 0. The basin heater operates when scheduled on and the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature is below the set point temperature described in the previous field. If this field is left blank, the basin heater is available to operate throughout the simulation. Regardless of this schedule, the basin heater may only operate when the DX coil is off.</p>
<h4 id="field-fuel-type">Field: Fuel Type</h4>
<p>This alpha field determines the type of fuel that this cooling coil uses.  This field has seven choices: Electricity, NaturalGas, PropaneGas, Coal, Diesel, Gasoline, FuelOil#1, FuelOil#2, OtherFuel1 and OtherFuel2. The default is NaturalGas.</p>
<h4 id="field-number-of-speeds">Field: Number of Speeds</h4>
<p>This field specifies the number of sets of data being entered for rated specifications, performance curves, evaporative condenser data, latent degradation data, and waste heat specifications for each cooling speed. The rated specifications consist of gross rated capacity, gross rated SHR, gross rated COP, and rated air flow rate. The performance curves consist of a total capacity modifier curve as a function of temperature, total capacity modifier curve as a function of flow fraction, energy input ratio modifier curve as a function of temperature, energy input ratio modifier curve as a function of flow fraction, and part load fraction correlation as a function of part load ratio. The evaporative condenser data consists of effectiveness, condenser air volume flow rate, and rated pump power consumption. The latent degradation data consists of nominal time for condensate removal to begin, ratio of initial moisture evaporation rate and steady-state latent capacity, maximum On/Off cycling rate, and latent capacity time constant. The latent degradation data are only applied if the supply air fan operation mode is specified as ContinuousFanWithCyclingCompressor. The waste heat specifications include the fraction of energy input to the cooling coil at the fully loaded and rated conditions, and a temperature modifier. The minimum number of speeds for cooling is 2 and the maximum number is 4. The number of speeds should be the same as the number of speeds for cooling defined in its parent object (AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:AirToAir:MultiSpeed). The first set of performance inputs is for Speed 1 and should be for low speed, and the last set of performance inputs should be for high speed. For example, if only three cooling speeds are defined, the first set should be for low speed (Speed 1), the second set should be for medium speed (Speed 2), and the third set should be for high speed (Speed 3). In this example, any performance inputs for Speed 4 would be neglected (since this input field specifies that the coil only has three cooling speeds).</p>
<h4 id="field-group-rated-specification-performance-curves-latent-capacity-degradation-inputs-and-evaporative-cooled-condenser-data">Field Group: Rated Specification, Performance Curves, Latent Capacity Degradation Inputs, and Evaporative Cooled Condenser Data</h4>

<h4 id="field-speed-x-gross-rated-total-cooling-capacity">Field: Speed &lt;x&gt; Gross Rated Total Cooling Capacity</h4>
<p>The total, full load gross cooling capacity (sensible plus latent) in watts of the DX coil unit for Speed &lt;x&gt; operation at rated conditions (air entering the cooling coil at 26.7°C drybulb/19.4°C wetbulb, air entering the outdoor condenser coil at 35°C drybulb/23.9°C wetbulb<a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a>, and a cooling coil air flow rate defined by field “Rated Air Flow Rate, Speed &lt;x&gt;” below). Capacity should be “gross” (i.e., the effect of supply air fan heat is NOT accounted for).</p>
<h4 id="field-speed-x-gross-rated-sensible-heat-ratio">Field: Speed &lt;x&gt; Gross Rated Sensible Heat Ratio</h4>

<h4 id="field-speed-x-gross-rated-cooling-cop">Field: Speed &lt;x&gt; Gross Rated Cooling COP</h4>
<p>The coefficient of performance is the ratio of the gross total cooling capacity in watts to electrical power input in watts) of the DX cooling coil unit for Speed &lt;x&gt; operation at rated conditions (air entering the cooling coil at 26.7°C drybulb/19.4°C wetbulb, air entering the outdoor condenser coil at 35°C drybulb/23.9°C wetbulb, and a cooling coil air flow rate defined by field “Rated Air Flow Rate, Speed &lt;x&gt;” below).

If this input field is left blank, the default value is 3.0.</p>
<h4 id="field-speed-x-rated-air-flow-rate">Field: Speed &lt;x&gt; Rated Air Flow Rate</h4>
<p>The volumetric air flow rate for Speed &lt;x&gt;, in m<sup>3</sup> per second, across the DX cooling coil at rated conditions. The rated air volume flow rate for Speed &lt;x&gt; should be between 0.00004027 m<sup>3</sup>/s and 0.00006041 m<sup>3</sup>/s per watt of the gross rated total cooling capacity for Speed &lt;x&gt;.

<p><strong><em>Field: Speed &lt;X&gt; Rated Evaporator Fan Power Per Volume Flow Rate</em></strong></p>
<p>This field is the electric power for the evaporator (cooling coil) fan per air volume flow rate through the coil at the rated conditions for Speed &lt;x&gt; in W/(m3/s). The default value is 773.3 W/(m3/s) (365 W/1000 cfm) if this field is left blank. If a value is entered, it must be &gt;= 0.0 and &lt;= 1250 W/(m3/s). This value is only used to calculate Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (SEER), and the Standard Rating (Net) Cooling Capacity which will be outputs in the EnergyPlus eio file (ref. EnergyPlus Engineering Reference, Multi-Speed DX Cooling Coil, Standard Ratings). This value is not used for modeling the evaporator (cooling coil) fan during simulations; instead, it is used for calculating SEER and Standard Rating Cooling Capacity to assist the user in verifying their inputs for modeling this type of equipment.</p>

The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated total cooling capacity for Speed &lt;x&gt; to give the gross total cooling capacity at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the rating point temperatures). The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 at the rating point.</p>
<h4 id="field-speed-x-total-cooling-capacity-function-of-flow-fraction-curve-name">Field: Speed &lt;x&gt; Total Cooling Capacity Function of Flow Fraction Curve Name</h4>
<p>The name of a quadratic performance curve (ref:  Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the gross total cooling capacity for Speed &lt;x&gt; as a function of the ratio of actual air flow rate across the cooling coil to the rated air flow rate for Speed &lt;x&gt; (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated total cooling capacity and the total cooling capacity modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the gross total cooling capacity for Speed &lt;x&gt; at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the coil is operating. The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate for Speed &lt;x&gt;.</p>
<h4 id="field-speed-x-energy-input-ratio-function-of-temperature-curve-name">Field: Speed &lt;x&gt; Energy Input Ratio Function of Temperature Curve Name</h4>
<p>The name of a biquadratic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input ratio (EIR) for Speed &lt;x&gt; as a function of the wetbulb temperature of the air entering the cooling coil and the drybulb temperature of the air entering the air-cooled condenser (wetbulb temperature if modeling an evaporative-cooled condenser).

The curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 at the rating point.</p>
<h4 id="field-speed-x-energy-input-ratio-function-of-flow-fraction-curve-name">Field: Speed &lt;x&gt; Energy Input Ratio Function of Flow Fraction Curve Name</h4>
<p>The name of a quadratic performance curve (Ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input ratio (EIR) for Speed &lt;x&gt; as a function of the ratio of actual air flow rate across the cooling coil to the rated air flow rate for Speed &lt;x&gt; (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The EIR is the inverse of the COP. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR and the EIR modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the EIR for Speed &lt;x&gt; at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the cooling coil is operating. This curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate for Speed &lt;x&gt;.</p>
<h4 id="field-speed-x-part-load-fraction-correlation-curve-name">Field: Speed &lt;x&gt; Part Load Fraction Correlation Curve Name</h4>
<p>This alpha field defines the name of a quadratic or cubic performance curve (Ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of electrical power input to the DX unit as a function of the part load ratio (PLR, sensible cooling load/steady-state sensible cooling capacity for Speed &lt;x&gt;). The product of the rated EIR and EIR modifier curves is divided by the output of this curve to give the “effective” EIR for a given simulation timestep for Speed &lt;x&gt;. The part load fraction (PLF) correlation accounts for efficiency losses due to compressor cycling.</p>
<p>The part load fraction correlation should be normalized to a value of 1.0 when the part load ratio equals 1.0 (i.e., no efficiency losses when the compressor(s) run continuously for the simulation timestep). For PLR values between 0 and 1 (0 &lt;= PLR &lt; 1), the following rules apply:</p>
<p>PLF &gt;= 0.7   and   PLF &gt;= PLR</p>
<p>If PLF &lt; 0.7 a warning message is issued, the program resets the PLF value to 0.7, and the simulation proceeds. The runtime fraction of the coil is defined as PLR/PLF. If PLF &lt; PLR, then a warning message is issued and the runtime fraction of the coil is limited to 1.0.</p>
<p>A typical part load fraction correlation for a conventional DX cooling coil (Speed &lt;x&gt;) would be:</p>
<p>PLF = 0.85 + 0.15(PLR)</p>
<p>If the user wishes to model no efficiency degradation due to compressor cycling, the part load fraction correlation should be defined as follows:</p>
<p>PLF = 1.0 + 0.0(PLR)</p>

<p>For Speed &lt;x&gt;, the nominal time (in seconds) after startup for condensate to begin leaving the coil's condensate drain line at the coil's rated airflow and temperature conditions, starting with a dry coil. Nominal time is equal to the ratio of the energy of the coil's maximum condensate holding capacity (J) to the coil's steady-state latent capacity (W). Suggested value is 1000; zero value means the latent degradation model is disabled. The default value for this field is zero. The supply air fan operating mode must be continuous (i.e., the supply air fan operating mode may be specified in other ”parent” objects and is assumed continuous in some objects (e.g., CoilSystem:Cooling:DX) or can be scheduled in other objects [e.g., AirloopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool]), and this field as well as the next three input fields for this object must have positive values in order to model latent capacity degradation for Speed &lt;x&gt;.</p>

Suggested value is 1.5; zero value means the latent degradation model is disabled. The default value for this field is zero. The supply air fan operating mode must be continuous (i.e., the supply air fan operating mode may be specified in other ”parent” objects and is assumed continuous in some objects (e.g., CoilSystem:Cooling:DX) or can be scheduled in other objects [e.g., AirloopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool]); and this field, the previous field and the next two fields must have positive values in order to model latent capacity degradation for Speed &lt;x&gt;.</p>

<p>For Speed &lt;x&gt;, the maximum on-off cycling rate for the compressor (cycles per hour), which occurs at 50% run time fraction. Suggested value is 3; zero value means latent degradation model is disabled. The default value for this field is zero. The supply air fan operating mode must be continuous (i.e., the supply air fan operating mode may be specified in other ”parent” objects and is assumed continuous in some objects (e.g., CoilSystem:Cooling:DX) or can be scheduled in other objects [e.g., AirloopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool]); and this field, the previous two fields and the next field must have positive values in order to model latent capacity degradation for Speed &lt;x&gt;.</p>
<h4 id="field-speed-x-latent-capacity-time-constant">Field: Speed &lt;x&gt; Latent Capacity Time Constant</h4>
<p>For Speed &lt;x&gt;, the time constant (in seconds) for the cooling coil's latent capacity to reach steady state after startup. Suggested value is 45; zero value means latent degradation model is disabled. The default value for this field is zero.

<h4 id="field-speed-x-rated-waste-heat-fraction-of-power-input">Field: Speed &lt;x&gt; Rated Waste Heat Fraction of Power Input</h4>
<p>The fraction of energy input to the cooling coil that is available as recoverable waste heat at full load and rated conditions for Speed &lt;x&gt;.</p>
<h4 id="field-speed-x-waste-heat-function-of-temperature-curve-name">Field: Speed &lt;x&gt; Waste Heat Function of Temperature Curve Name</h4>
<p>The name of a biquadratic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the waste heat recovery as a function of outdoor dry-bulb temperature and the entering coil dry-bulb temperature at Speed &lt;x&gt;. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated waste heat fraction at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the rating point). The curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 at the rating point. When the fuel type is electricity, this field can remain blank since it is ignored by the program in this instance.</p>
<h4 id="field-speed-x-evaporative-condenser-effectiveness">Field: Speed &lt;x&gt; Evaporative Condenser Effectiveness</h4>
<p>The effectiveness of the evaporative condenser at Speed &lt;x&gt;, which is used to determine the temperature of the air entering the outdoor condenser coil as follows:</p>
<div>\[Tcond\,inlet = \,\left( {Twb,o} \right)\,\, + \,\,\left( {1 - EvapCondEffectivenes{s_{Speed1}}} \right)\left( {Tdb,o\,\, - Twb,o} \right)\]</div>

<p>where</p>
<p><em>T<sub>cond\ inlet</sub></em> = the temperature of the air entering the condenser coil (C)</p>
<p><em>T<sub>wb,o</sub></em> = the wet-bulb temperature of the outdoor air (C)</p>
<p><em>T<sub>db,o</sub></em> = the dry-bulb temperature of the outdoor air (C)</p>
<p>The resulting condenser inlet air temperature is used by the Total Cooling Capacity Modifier Curve, Speed &lt;x&gt; (function of temperature) and the Energy Input Ratio Modifier Curve, Speed &lt;x&gt; (function of temperature). The default value for this field is 0.9, although valid entries can range from 0.0 to 1.0. This field is not used when Condenser Type = Air Cooled.</p>
<p>If the user wants to model an air-cooled condenser, they should simply specify AirCooled in the field Condenser Type. In this case, the Total Cooling Capacity Modifier Curve, Speed &lt;x&gt; (function of temperature) and the Energy Input Ratio Modifier Curve, Speed &lt;x&gt; (function of temperature) input fields for this object should reference performance curves that are a function of outdoor dry-bulb temperature.</p>
<p>If the user wishes to model an evaporative-cooled condenser AND they have performance curves that are a function of the wet-bulb temperature of air entering the condenser coil, then the user should specify Condenser Type = Evap Cooled and the evaporative condenser effectiveness value should be entered as 1.0. In this case, the Total Cooling Capacity Modifier Curve, Speed &lt;x&gt; (function of temperature) and the Energy Input Ratio Modifier Curve, Speed &lt;x&gt; (function of temperature) input fields for this object should reference performance curves that are a function of the wet-bulb temperature of air entering the condenser coil.</p>
<p>If the user wishes to model an air-cooled condenser that has evaporative media placed in front of it to cool the air entering the condenser coil, then the user should specify Condenser Type = Evap Cooled. The user must also enter the appropriate evaporative effectiveness for the media. In this case, the Total Cooling Capacity Modifier Curve, Speed &lt;x&gt; (function of temperature) and the Energy Input Ratio Modifier Curve, Speed &lt;x&gt; (function of temperature) input fields for this object should reference performance curves that are a function of outdoor dry-bulb temperature. Be aware that the evaporative media will significantly reduce the dry-bulb temperature of the air entering the condenser coil, so the Total Cooling Capacity and EIR Modifier Curves for Speed &lt;x&gt; must be valid for the expected range of dry-bulb temperatures that will be entering the condenser coil.</p>

This value is used to calculate the amount of water used to evaporatively cool the condenser inlet air. The minimum value for this field must be greater than zero, and this input field is autosizable (equivalent to 0.000114 m<sup>3</sup>/s per watt of rated total cooling capacity for Speed &lt;x&gt; [850 cfm/ton]). This field is not used when Condenser Type = Air Cooled.</p>

<p>The rated power of the evaporative condenser water pump in Watts at Speed &lt;x&gt;. This value is used to calculate the power required to pump the water used to evaporatively cool the condenser inlet air. The default value for this input field is zero, but it is autosizable (equivalent to 0.004266 W per watt [15 W/ton] of rated total capacity for Speed &lt;x&gt;). This field is not used when Condenser Type = Air Cooled.</p>
<h4 id="field-zone-name-for-condenser-placement_2">Field: Zone Name for Condenser Placement</h4>
<p>This input field is name of a conditioned or unconditioned zone where the secondary coil (condenser) of DX system or a heat pump is to be placed.

<h3 id="coilcoolingdxvariablespeed">Coil:Cooling:DX:VariableSpeed</h3>
<p>The Variable-Speed DX Cooling Coil is a collection of performance curves that represent the cooling coil at various speed levels. The performance curves should be generated from a Reference Unit data. This is an equation-fit model that resembles a black box with no usage of heat transfer equations. On the other hand, the model uses the bypass factor approach to calculate sensible heat transfer rate, similar to the one used in the single-speed DX coil. The number of speed levels can range from 1 to 10. The cooling coil has two indoor air side connections, and one optional condenser air node connection. The user needs to specify a nominal speed level, at which the gross rated total cooling capacity, and rated volumetric air rate are sized. The rated capacity and rated volumetric flow rate represent the real situation in the air loop, and are used to determine and flow rates at various speed levels in the parent objects, e.g. of AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool, ZoneHVAC:PackagedTerminalAirConditioner, AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:AirToAir and ZoneHVAC:PackagedTerminalHeatPump. It shall be mentioned that the performance correction curves, i.e. the temperature and flow fraction correction curves, should be normalized to the capacity and flow rate at each individual speed and at the rated conditions, similar to the performance curves used in the single-speed DX coil. However, the performance values, e.g. capacities, COPs, SHRs and flow rates at individual speed levels, should be given regarding a specific unit from the Reference Unit catalog data. In the following content, the statement started with “Reference Unit” means the actual Reference Unit catalog data. The rated conditions for obtaining the capacities, COPs and SHRs  are at indoor dry-bulb temperature of 26.67 ˚C (80 ˚F), wet bulb temperature of 19.44 ˚C (67 ˚F),  and the condenser entering air temperature of 35 ˚C (95 ˚F).

<h3 id="coilperformancedxcooling">CoilPerformance:DX:Cooling</h3>
<p>This coil performance object is used to specify DX coil performance for one mode of operation for a Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoStageWithHumidityControlMode. A single Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoStageWithHumidityControlMode object will reference one to four CoilPerformance:DX:Cooling objects depending on the number of available stages and dehumidification modes as specified in the two stage DX object. For example, a standard 2-stage DX system will use two of these performance objects, one to defined the capacity and performance for stage 1 operation, and a second one for stage 1+2 (both stages active) operation. In nearly all cases, the Rated Air Volume Flow Rate will be the same for all performance objects associated with a given multimode DX coil. If bypass is specified, the Rated Air Volume Flow Rate includes both the bypassed flow and the flow through the active coil.</p>
<p>This DX coil model is identical to Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed  with addition of bypass and multi-stage capabilities. This DX cooling coil model and input are quite different from that for the heating and cooling water coils. The simple water coils use an NTU-effectiveness heat exchanger model. The single speed DX coil model uses performance information at rated conditions along with curve fits for variations in total capacity, energy input ratio and part-load fraction to determine performance at part-load conditions. Sensible/latent capacity splits are determined by the rated sensible heat ratio (SHR) and the apparatus dewpoint/bypass factor (ADP/BF) approach. This approach is analogous to the NTU-effectiveness calculations used for sensible-only heat exchanger calculations, extended to a cooling and dehumidifying coil.</p>
<p>An alternative to ADP/BF method for sensible/latent capacity split is to use SHR modifier curves for temperature and flow fraction.  These two optional input fields are used only when a user specified SHR calculation method desired over the (ADP/BF) method.  Sensible heat ratio calculated using these two SHR modifier curves override the value calculated by ADP/BF method. See section “SHR Calculation Using User Specified SHR Modifier Curves” in the EnergyPlus Engineering Document for further details.</p>
<p>The DX cooling coil input requires the gross rated total cooling capacity, the gross rated SHR, the gross rated COP, the rated air volume flow rate, and the fraction of air flow which is bypassed around the coil. The first 4 inputs determine the coil performance at the rating point (air entering the cooling coil at 26.7°C drybulb/19.4°C wetbulb and air entering the outdoor condenser coil at 35°C drybulb/23.9°C wetbulb). The rated air volume flow rate (less any bypassed fraction) should be between .00004027 m<sup>3</sup>/s and .00006041 m<sup>3</sup>/s per watt of gross rated total cooling capacity (300 to 450 cfm/ton). The rated volumetric air flow to gross total cooling capacity ratio for 100% dedicated outdoor air (DOAS) application DX cooling coils should be between 0.00001677 (m3/s)/W (125 cfm/ton) and 0.00003355 (m3/s)/W (250 cfm/ton).</p>
<p>This model requires 5 curves as follows:</p>
<p>1.    The total cooling capacity modifier curve (function of temperature) is a biquadratic curve with two independent variables: wet-bulb temperature of the air entering the cooling coil, and dry-bulb temperature of the air entering the air-cooled condenser coil (wet-bulb temperature if modeling an evaporative-cooled condenser). The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated total cooling capacity to give the gross total cooling capacity at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the rating point temperatures).</p>
<p>2.    The total cooling capacity modifier curve (function of flow fraction) is a quadratic or cubic curve with the independent variable being the ratio of the actual air flow rate across the cooling coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated total cooling capacity and the total cooling capacity modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the gross total cooling capacity at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the coil is operating.</p>
<p>3.    The energy input ratio (EIR) modifier curve (function of temperature) is a biquadratic curve with two independent variables: wet-bulb temperature of the air entering the cooling coil, and dry-bulb temperature of the air entering the air-cooled condenser coil (wet-bulb temperature if modeling an evaporative-cooled condenser). The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR (inverse of the rated COP) to give the EIR at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the rating point temperatures).</p>
<p>4.    The energy input ratio (EIR) modifier curve (function of flow fraction) is a quadratic or cubic curve with the independent variable being the ratio of the actual air flow rate across the cooling coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR (inverse of the rated COP) and the EIR modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the EIR at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the coil is operating.</p>
<p>5.    The part load fraction correlation (function of part load ratio) is a quadratic or cubic curve with the independent variable being part load ratio (sensible cooling load / steady-state sensible cooling capacity). The output of this curve is used in combination with the rated EIR and EIR modifier curves to give the “effective” EIR for a given simulation timestep. The part load fraction (PLF) correlation accounts for efficiency losses due to compressor cycling. The curve should be normalized to a value of 1.0 when the part-load ratio equals 1.0 (i.e., the compressor(s) run continuously for the simulation timestep).</p>
<p>The curves are simply specified by name. Curve inputs are described in the curve manager section of this document (see Performance Curves in this document).</p>
<p>The next four input fields are optional and relate to the degradation of latent cooling capacity when the supply air fan operates continuously while the cooling coil/compressor cycle on and off to meet the cooling load. The fan operating mode is either considered to be constant (e.g. CoilSystem:Cooling:DX) or can be scheduled in the parent object (e.g. AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool). When scheduled, the schedule value must be greater than 0 to calculate degradation of latent cooling capacity. At times when the parent object’s supply air fan operating mode schedule is 0, latent degradation will be ignored. When used, these next four input fields must all have positive values in order to model latent capacity degradation.</p>
<p>The next input specifies the outdoor air node used to define the conditions of the air entering the outdoor condenser. If this field is not blank, the node name specified must be listed in an OutdoorAir:Node object where the height of the node is taken into consideration when calculating outdoor temperature from the weather data. Alternately, the node name must be specified in an OutdoorAir:NodeList object where the outdoor temperature entering the condenser is taken directly from the weather data. This field may also be left blank, if this is the case then the outdoor temperature entering the condenser is taken directly from the weather data.</p>
<p>The next input describes the type of outdoor condenser coil used with the DX cooling coil (Air Cooled or Evap Cooled). The following three inputs are required when modeling an evaporative-cooled condenser: evaporative condenser effectiveness, evaporative condenser air volume flow rate, and the power consumed by the evaporative condenser pump. See section “DX Cooling Coil Model” in the EnergyPlus Engineering Document for further details regarding this model.</p>

<p>The sensible heat ratio (SHR=gross sensible capacity divided by gross total cooling capacity) of the DX cooling coil at rated conditions (air entering the cooling coil at 26.7°C drybulb/19.4°C wetbulb, air entering the outdoor condenser coil at 35°C drybulb/23.9°C wetbulb, and a cooling coil air flow rate defined by field “rated air flow rate” below). Both the sensible and total cooling capacities used to define the Rated SHR should be “gross” (i.e., the effect of supply air fan heat is NOT accounted for).</p>
<h4 id="field-gross-rated-cooling-cop_1">Field: Gross Rated Cooling COP</h4>
<p>The coefficient of performance is the ratio of the gross total cooling capacity in watts to electrical power input in watts) of the DX cooling coil unit at rated conditions (air entering the cooling coil at 26.7°C drybulb/19.4°C wetbulb, air entering the outdoor condenser coil at 35°C drybulb/ 23.9°C wetbulb, and a cooling coil air flow rate defined by field “rated air flow rate” below). The input power includes electric power for the compressor(s) and condenser fan(s) but does not include the power consumption of the supply air fan. If this input field is left blank, the default value is 3.0.</p>
<h4 id="field-rated-air-flow-rate_3">Field: Rated Air Flow Rate</h4>

<h4 id="field-fraction-of-air-flow-bypassed-around-coil">Field: Fraction of Air Flow Bypassed Around Coil</h4>
<p>This numeric field specifies the fraction of the Rated Air Volume Flow Rate which bypasses the active cooling coil for this performance mode. The remaining portion of the flow should be between 0.00004027 m3/s and .00006041 m3/s per watt of gross rated total cooling capacity (300 to 450 cfm/ton) for this performance mode. For DOAS applications the remaining portion of rated air volume flow rate should be between 0.00001677 m<sup>3</sup>/s and 0.00003355 m<sup>3</sup>/s per watt of gross rated total cooling capacity (125 to 250 cfm/ton).  This is used to model face-split coils on multi-stage units or bypass dampers. If total flow rate varies during simulation, the same fraction is bypassed. This input may range from 0.0 to &lt;1.0. The default is 0.0. For a multi-stage face-split coil in which stage 1 is 60% of total capacity, this field would be set to 0.4 for the Stage 1 performance and set to 0.0 for the Stage 1+2 performance. For a DX system which activates a bypass damper for improved dehumidification, this field would be set to 0.0 for normal mode performance and set to something greater than zero for enhanced dehumidification mode performance.</p>
<h4 id="field-total-cooling-capacity-function-of-temperature-curve-name_2">Field: Total Cooling Capacity Function of Temperature Curve Name</h4>
<p>The name of a <strong>biquadratic</strong> performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the total gross cooling capacity as a function of the wet-bulb temperature of the air entering the cooling coil, and the dry-bulb temperature of the air entering the air-cooled condenser coil (wet-bulb temperature if modeling an evaporative-cooled condenser). The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated total cooling capacity to give the gross total cooling capacity at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the rating point temperatures). The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 at the rating point.</p>
<h4 id="field-total-cooling-capacity-function-of-flow-fraction-curve-name_2">Field: Total Cooling Capacity Function of Flow Fraction Curve Name</h4>
<p>The name of a <strong>quadratic</strong> or <strong>cubic</strong> performance curve (ref:  Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the gross total cooling capacity as a function of the ratio of actual air flow rate across the cooling coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated total cooling capacity and the total cooling capacity modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the gross total cooling capacity at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the coil is operating. The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate.</p>
<h4 id="field-energy-input-ratio-function-of-temperature-curve-name_2">Field: Energy Input Ratio Function of Temperature Curve Name</h4>
<p>The name of a <strong>biquadratic</strong> performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input ratio (EIR) as a function of the wet-bulb temperature of the air entering the cooling coil, and the dry-bulb temperature of the air entering the air-cooled condenser coil (wet-bulb temperature if modeling an evaporative-cooled condenser). The EIR is the inverse of the COP. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR (inverse of rated COP) to give the EIR at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the rating point temperatures). The curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 at the rating point.</p>
<h4 id="field-energy-input-ratio-function-of-flow-fraction-curve-name_2">Field: Energy Input Ratio Function of Flow Fraction Curve Name</h4>
<p>The name of a <strong>quadratic</strong> or <strong>cubic</strong> performance curve (Ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input ratio (EIR) as a function of the ratio of actual air flow rate across the cooling coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The EIR is the inverse of the COP. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR and the EIR modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the EIR at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the cooling coil is operating. This curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate.</p>
<h4 id="field-part-load-fraction-correlation-curve-name_5">Field: Part Load Fraction Correlation Curve Name</h4>
<p>This alpha field defines the name of a <strong>quadratic</strong> or <strong>cubic</strong> performance curve (Ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of electrical power input to the DX unit as a function of the part load ratio (PLR, sensible cooling load/steady-state sensible cooling capacity). The product of the rated EIR and EIR modifier curves is divided by the output of this curve to give the “effective” EIR for a given simulation timestep. The part load fraction (PLF) correlation accounts for efficiency losses due to compressor cycling.</p>
<p>The part load fraction correlation should be normalized to a value of 1.0 when the part load ratio equals 1.0 (i.e., no efficiency losses when the compressor(s) run continuously for the simulation timestep). For PLR values between 0 and 1 (0 &lt;= PLR &lt; 1), the following rules apply:</p>
<p>PLF &gt;= 0.7   and   PLF &gt;= PLR</p>
<p>If PLF &lt; 0.7 a warning message is issued, the program resets the PLF value to 0.7, and the simulation proceeds. The runtime fraction of the coil is defined as PLR/PLF. If PLF &lt; PLR, then a warning message is issued and the runtime fraction of the coil is limited to 1.0.</p>
<p>A typical part load fraction correlation for a conventional, single-speed DX cooling coil (e.g., residential unit) would be:</p>
<p>PLF = 0.85 + 0.15(PLR)</p>
<p>If the user wishes to model no efficiency degradation due to compressor cycling, the part load fraction correlation should be defined as follows:</p>
<p>PLF = 1.0 + 0.0(PLR)</p>
<h4 id="field-nominal-time-for-condensate-removal-to-begin_2">Field: Nominal Time for Condensate Removal to Begin</h4>
<p>The nominal time (in seconds) after startup for condensate to begin leaving the coil's condensate drain line at the coil's rated airflow and temperature conditions, starting with a dry coil. Nominal time is equal to the ratio of the energy of the coil's maximum condensate holding capacity (J) to the coil's steady-state latent capacity (W). Suggested value is 1000; zero value means the latent degradation model is disabled. The default value for this field is zero. The supply air fan operating mode must be continuous (i.e., the supply air fan operating mode may be specified in other ”parent” objects and is assumed continuous in some objects (e.g., CoilSystem:Cooling:DX) or can be scheduled in other objects [e.g., AirloopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool]), and this field as well as the next three input fields for this object must have positive values in order to model latent capacity degradation.</p>

<p>Ratio of the initial moisture evaporation rate from the cooling coil (when the compressor first turns off, in Watts) and the coil's steady-state latent capacity (Watts) at rated airflow and temperature conditions. Suggested value is 1.5; zero value means the latent degradation model is disabled. The default value for this field is zero. The supply air fan operating mode must be continuous (i.e., the supply air fan operating mode may be specified in other ”parent” objects and is assumed continuous in some objects (e.g., CoilSystem:Cooling:DX) or can be scheduled in other objects [e.g., AirloopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool]); and this field, the previous field and the next two fields must have positive values in order to model latent capacity degradation.</p>
<h4 id="field-maximum-cycling-rate_1">Field: Maximum Cycling Rate</h4>
<p>The maximum on-off cycling rate for the compressor (cycles per hour), which occurs at 50% run time fraction. Suggested value is 3; zero value means latent degradation model is disabled. The default value for this field is zero. The supply air fan operating mode must be continuous (i.e., the supply air fan operating mode may be specified in other ”parent” objects and is assumed continuous in some objects (e.g., CoilSystem:Cooling:DX) or can be scheduled in other objects [e.g., AirloopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool]); and this field, the previous two fields and the next field must have positive values in order to model latent capacity degradation.</p>
<h4 id="field-latent-capacity-time-constant_1">Field: Latent Capacity Time Constant</h4>
<p>Time constant (in seconds) for the cooling coil's latent capacity to reach steady state after startup. Suggested value is 45; zero value means latent degradation model is disabled. The default value for this field is zero. The supply air fan operating mode must be continuous (i.e., the supply air fan operating mode may be specified in other ”parent” objects and is assumed continuous in some objects (e.g., CoilSystem:Cooling:DX) or can be scheduled in other objects [e.g., AirloopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool]), and this field as well as the previous three input fields for this object must have positive values in order to model latent capacity degradation.</p>
<h4 id="field-condenser-air-inlet-node-name_4">Field: Condenser Air Inlet Node Name</h4>
<p>This optional alpha field specifies the outdoor air node name used to define the conditions of the air entering the outdoor condenser. If this field is left blank, the outdoor air temperature entering the condenser (dry-bulb or wet-bulb) is taken directly from the weather data. If this field is not blank, the node name specified must also be specified in an OutdoorAir:Node object where the height of the node is taken into consideration when calculating outdoor air temperature from the weather data. Alternately, the node name may be specified in an OutdoorAir:NodeList object where the outdoor air temperature is taken directly from the weather data.</p>
<h4 id="field-condenser-type_4">Field: Condenser Type</h4>
<p>The type of condenser used by the DX cooling coil. Valid choices for this input field are <strong>AirCooled</strong> or <strong>EvaporativelyCooled</strong>. The default for this field is <strong>AirCooled</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="field-evaporative-condenser-effectiveness_1">Field: Evaporative Condenser Effectiveness</h4>
<p>The effectiveness of the evaporative condenser, which is used to determine the temperature of the air entering the outdoor condenser coil as follows:</p>
<div>\[Tcond\,inlet = \,\left( {Twb,o} \right)\,\, + \,\,\left( {1 - EvapCondEffectiveness} \right)\left( {Tdb,o\,\, - Twb,o} \right)\]</div>

<p>where</p>
<p><em>T<sub>cond\ inlet</sub></em> = the temperature of the air entering the condenser coil (C)</p>
<p><em>T<sub>wb,o</sub></em> = the wet-bulb temperature of the outdoor air (C)</p>
<p><em>T<sub>db,o</sub></em> = the dry-bulb temperature of the outdoor air (C)</p>
<p>The resulting condenser inlet air temperature is used by the Total Cooling Capacity Modifier Curve (function of temperature) and the Energy Input Ratio Modifier Curve (function of temperature). The default value for this field is 0.9, although valid entries can range from 0.0 to 1.0. This field is not used when Condenser Type = Air Cooled.</p>
<p>If the user wants to model an air-cooled condenser, they should simply specify AirCooled in the field Condenser Type. In this case, the Total Cooling Capacity Modifier Curve (function of temperature) and the Energy Input Ratio Modifier Curve (function of temperature) input fields for this object should reference performance curves that are a function of outdoor dry-bulb temperature.</p>
<p>If the user wishes to model an evaporative-cooled condenser AND they have performance curves that are a function of the wet-bulb temperature of air entering the condenser coil, then the user should specify Condenser Type = Evap Cooled and the evaporative condenser effectiveness value should be entered as 1.0. In this case, the Total Cooling Capacity Modifier Curve (function of temperature) and the Energy Input Ratio Modifier Curve (function of temperature) input fields for this object should reference performance curves that are a function of the wet-bulb temperature of air entering the condenser coil.</p>
<p>If the user wishes to model an air-cooled condenser that has evaporative media placed in front of it to cool the air entering the condenser coil, then the user should specify Condenser Type = Evap Cooled. The user must also enter the appropriate evaporative effectiveness for the media. In this case, the Total Cooling Capacity Modifier Curve (function of temperature) and the Energy Input Ratio Modifier Curve (function of temperature) input fields for this object should reference performance curves that are a function of outdoor dry-bulb temperature. Be aware that the evaporative media will significantly reduce the dry-bulb temperature of the air entering the condenser coil, so the Total Cooling Capacity and EIR Modifier Curves must be valid for the expected range of dry-bulb temperatures that will be entering the condenser coil.</p>
<h4 id="field-evaporative-condenser-air-flow-rate_1">Field: Evaporative Condenser Air Flow Rate</h4>
<p>The air volume flow rate, in m<sup>3</sup> per second, entering the evaporative condenser. This value is used to calculate the amount of water used to evaporatively cool the condenser inlet air. The minimum value for this field must be greater than zero, and this input field is autosizable (equivalent to 0.000144 m<sup>3</sup>/s per watt of rated total cooling capacity [850 cfm/ton]). This field is not used when Condenser Type = Air Cooled.</p>
<h4 id="field-evaporative-condenser-pump-rated-power-consumption_2">Field: Evaporative Condenser Pump Rated Power Consumption</h4>
<p>The rated power of the evaporative condenser water pump in Watts. This value is used to calculate the power required to pump the water used to evaporatively cool the condenser inlet air. The default value for this input field is zero, but it is autosizable (equivalent to 0.004266 W per watt [15 W/ton] of rated total cooling capacity). This field is not used when Condenser Type = AirCooled.</p>
<h4 id="field-sensible-heat-ratio-function-of-temperature-curve-name_2">Field: Sensible Heat Ratio Function of Temperature Curve Name</h4>
<p>The name of a biquadratic normalized curve (Ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the sensible heat ratio (SHR) as a function of DX cooling coil entering air wet-bulb and dry-bulb temperatures. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated SHR and the SHR modifier curve (function of flow fraction) to give the SHR at the specific coil entering air temperature and air flow conditions at which the cooling coil is operating. This curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 at the rated condition. This input field is optional.</p>

This curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate. This input field is optional.</p>

<h3 id="coil-performance-dx-cooling-outputs">Coil Performance DX Cooling Outputs</h3>
<p>The CoilPerformance:DX:Cooling object does not have specific output variables. To request reports, use the parent object Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoStageWithHumidityControlMode output variable options (ref. DX Cooling Coil Outputs). When requesting specific output variables by name, use the name of the parent object as the Key Value for Output:Variable reporting objects (ref. Output:Variable object). The name of the CoilPerformance:DX:Cooling object cannot be used as a Key Value in the Output:Variable object.</p>
<h3 id="coilheatingdxsinglespeed">Coil:Heating:DX:SingleSpeed</h3>
<p>The single speed heating DX coil model uses performance information at rated conditions along with curve fits for variations in total capacity, energy input ratio and part load fraction to determine performance at part-load conditions. The impacts of various defrost strategies (reverse cycle, resistive, timed or on-demand) are modeled based on a combination of user inputs and empirical models taken from the air-to-air heat pump algorithms in DOE-2.1E.</p>
<p>The single speed heating DX coil input requires an availability schedule, the gross rated heating capacity, the gross rated COP and the rated air volume flow rate. The latter 3 inputs determine the coil performance at the rating point (outdoor air dry-bulb temperature of 8.33 C, outdoor air wet-bulb temperature of 6.11 C, coil entering air dry-bulb temperature of 21.11 C, coil entering air wet-bulb temperature of 15.55 C). The rated air volume flow rate should be between .00004027 m<sup>3</sup>/s and .00006041 m<sup>3</sup>/s per watt of gross rated heating capacity.</p>
<p>Up to 6 curves are required depending on the defrost strategy selected.</p>
<p>1)    The heating capacity modifier curve (function of temperature) can be a function of both the outdoor and indoor air dry-bulb temperature or only the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature. User has the choice of a bi-quadratic curve with two independent variables or a quadratic curve as well as a cubic curve with a single independent variable. The bi-quadratic curve is recommended if sufficient manufacturer data is available as it provides sensitivity to the indoor air dry-bulb temperature and a more realistic output. The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated heating capacity to give the gross heating capacity at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at an outdoor or indoor air temperature different from the rating point temperature).</p>
<p>2)    The heating capacity modifier curve (function of flow fraction) is a quadratic or cubic curve with the independent variable being the ratio of the actual air flow rate across the heating coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated heating capacity and the heating capacity modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the gross heating capacity at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the coil is operating.</p>
<p>3)    The energy input ratio (EIR) modifier curve (function of temperature) can be a function of both the outdoor and indoor air dry-bulb temperature or only the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature. User has the choice of a bi-quadratic curve with two independent variables or a quadratic curve as well as a cubic curve with a single independent variable. The bi-quadratic curve is recommended if sufficient manufacturer data is available as it provides sensitivity to the indoor air dry-bulb temperature and a more realistic output. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR (inverse of the rated COP) to give the EIR at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at an outdoor or indoor air temperature different from the rating point temperature).</p>
<p>4)    The energy input ratio (EIR) modifier curve (function of flow fraction) is a quadratic or cubic curve with the independent variable being the ratio of the actual air flow rate across the heating coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR (inverse of the rated COP) and the EIR modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the EIR at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the coil is operating.</p>
<p>5)    The part load fraction correlation (function of part load ratio) is a quadratic or cubic curve with the independent variable being part load ratio (sensible heating load / steady-state heating capacity). The output of this curve is used in combination with the rated EIR and EIR modifier curves to give the “effective” EIR for a given simulation timestep. The part load fraction correlation accounts for efficiency losses due to compressor cycling.</p>
<p>6)    The defrost energy input ratio (EIR) modifier curve (function of temperature) is a bi-quadratic curve with two independent variables: outdoor air dry-bulb temperature and the heating coil entering air wet-bulb temperature. The output of this curve is multiplied by the heating coil capacity, the fractional defrost time period and the runtime fraction of the heating coil to give the defrost power at the specific temperatures at which the coil is operating. This curve is only required when a reverse-cycle defrost strategy is specified.</p>
<p>The curves are simply specified by name. Curve inputs are described in the curve manager section of this document (ref. Performance Curves).</p>
<p>The next input item for the coil is the supply air fan operation mode. Either the supply air fan runs continuously while the DX coil cycles on/off, or the fan and coil cycle on/off together. The next two inputs define the minimum outdoor dry-bulb temperature that the heat pump compressor will operate and the maximum outdoor dry-bulb temperature for defrost operation. Crankcase heater capacity and cutout temperature are entered in the following two inputs. The final four inputs cover the type of defrost strategy (reverse-cycle or resistive), defrost control (timed or on-demand), the fractional defrost time period (timed defrost control only), and the resistive defrost heater capacity if a resistive defrost strategy is selected.</p>

The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 at the rating point.</p>
<h4 id="field-energy-input-ratio-function-of-flow-fraction-curve-name_3">Field: Energy Input Ratio Function of Flow Fraction Curve Name</h4>
<p>This alpha field defines the name of a quadratic or cubic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input ratio (EIR) as a function of the ratio of actual air flow rate across the heating coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The EIR is the inverse of the COP. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR and the EIR modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the EIR at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the coil is operating. This curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate.</p>
<h4 id="field-part-load-fraction-correlation-curve-name_6">Field: Part Load Fraction Correlation Curve Name</h4>
<p>This alpha field defines the name of a quadratic or cubic performance curve (Ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of electrical power input to the DX unit as a function of the part load ratio (PLR, sensible cooling load/steady-state sensible cooling capacity). The product of the rated EIR and EIR modifier curves is divided by the output of this curve to give the “effective” EIR for a given simulation timestep. The part load fraction (PLF) correlation accounts for efficiency losses due to compressor cycling.</p>
<p>The part load fraction correlation should be normalized to a value of 1.0 when the part load ratio equals 1.0 (i.e., no efficiency losses when the compressor(s) run continuously for the simulation timestep). For PLR values between 0 and 1 (0 &lt;= PLR &lt; 1), the following rules apply:</p>
<p>PLF &gt;= 0.7   and   PLF &gt;= PLR</p>
<p>If PLF &lt; 0.7 a warning message is issued, the program resets the PLF value to 0.7, and the simulation proceeds. The runtime fraction of the coil is defined as PLR/PLF. If PLF &lt; PLR, then a warning message is issued and the runtime fraction of the coil is limited to 1.0.</p>
<p>A typical part load fraction correlation for a conventional, single-speed DX cooling coil (e.g., residential unit) would be:</p>
<p>PLF = 0.85 + 0.15(PLR)</p>
<p>If the user wishes to model no efficiency degradation due to compressor cycling, the part load fraction correlation should be defined as follows:</p>
<p>PLF = 1.0 + 0.0(PLR)</p>

The output of this curve is multiplied by the coil capacity, the fractional defrost time period and the runtime fraction of the heating coil to give the defrost power at the specific temperatures at which the indoor and outdoor coils are operating. This curve is only required when a reverse-cycle defrost strategy is selected. The curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 at the rating point conditions.</p>

<h4 id="field-defrost-control">Field: Defrost Control</h4>
<p>This alpha field has two choices: timed or on-demand. If timed control is selected, the defrost time period is calculated based on a fixed value or compressor runtime whether or not frost has actually accumulated. For timed defrost control, the fractional amount of time the unit is in defrost is entered in the input field “Defrost Time Period Fraction” described below. If on-demand defrost control is selected, the defrost time period is calculated based on outdoor weather (humidity ratio) conditions.

<h3 id="coilheatingdxmultispeed">Coil:Heating:DX:MultiSpeed</h3>
<h3 id="coilheatingdxmultispeed_1">Coil:Heating:DX:MultiSpeed</h3>
<p>This component models a DX heating unit with multiple discrete levels of heating capacity. Currently, this heating coil can only be referenced by a AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:AirToAir:MultiSpeed compound object. The multispeed DX heating coil can have from two to four operating speeds. When the coil operates at Speed 1 (the lowest speed), its performance is very similar to the Coil:Heating:DX:SingleSpeed object where the impacts of part-load ratio can be included. When the coil operates at higher speeds (above Speed 1), the linear approximation methodology is applied. The coil outputs at two consecutive speeds are linearly interpolated to meet the required heating capacity during an HVAC system timestep. When the coil performs above the lowest speed, the user can choose if they want to include part-load ratio impacts at the higher speeds.</p>
<p>The multispeed unit is described by specifying the performance at different operating speeds. Each speed has its own set of input specifications: full load capacity, COP and air flow rate at rated conditions, along with modifier curves to determine performance when actual operating conditions are different from the rated conditions.</p>
<p>The coil operates to meet the sensible capacity being requested. When this requested capacity is above the sensible capacity of the highest operating speed, the coil runs continuously at the highest speed. When the requested capacity is between the sensible capacities of two consecutive speeds, the unit will operate a portion of the time at each speed to meet the request. When the requested capacity is less than the low speed (Speed 1) capacity, the unit will cycle on/off as needed.</p>
<p>The next input defines the minimum outdoor dry-bulb temperature where the compressor will operate. The followed two inputs are related to crankcase heater operation: capacity and maximum outdoor dry-bulb temperature for crankcase heater operation. The next six inputs cover defrost operation: defrost EIR modifier curve, the maximum outdoor dry-bulb temperature for defrost operation, the type of defrost strategy (reverse-cycle or resistive), defrost control (timed or on-demand), the fractional defrost time period (timed defrost control only), and the resistive defrost heater capacity if a resistive defrost strategy is selected. The activation of defrost is dependent on outdoor conditions. The capacity reduction and energy use modification are independent of speed. The defrost EIR modifier is described below:</p>
<p>The defrost energy input ratio (EIR) modifier curve (function of temperature) is a bi-quadratic curve with two independent variables: outdoor air dry-bulb temperature and the heating coil entering air wet-bulb temperature. The output of this curve is multiplied by the heating coil capacity, the fractional defrost time period and the runtime fraction of the heating coil to give the defrost power at the specific temperatures at which the coil is operating. This curve is only required when a reverse-cycle defrost strategy is specified.</p>
<p>The next input allows the user to choose whether to apply the part load fraction correlation to speeds greater than 1 or not. The following input is the type of fuel.</p>
<p>Then the number of speed for heating is entered. The rest of inputs are speed dependent. Each set of data consists of gross rated heating capacity, gross rated COP, and the rated air volume flow rate. These three inputs determine the coil performance at the rating point (outdoor air dry-bulb temperature of 8.33°C, outdoor air wet-bulb temperature of 6.11°C, coil entering air dry-bulb temperature of 21.11°C, coil entering air wet-bulb temperature of 15.55°C). The rated air volume flow rate should be between .00004027 m<sup>3</sup>/s and .00006041 m<sup>3</sup>/s per watt of gross rated heating capacity. The rated waste heat fraction is needed to calculate how much waste heat is available at the rated conditions. In addition, up to 6 modifier curves are required per speed.</p>
<p>1)    The heating capacity modifier curve (function of temperature) can be a function of both the outdoor and indoor air dry-bulb temperature or only the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature. User has the choice of a bi-quadratic curve with two independent variables or a quadratic curve as well as a cubic curve with a single independent variable. The bi-quadratic curve is recommended if sufficient manufacturer data is available as it provides sensitivity to the indoor air dry-bulb temperature and a more realistic output. The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated heating capacity to give the gross total heating capacity at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at an outdoor or indoor air temperature different from the rating point temperature).</p>

<p>5)    The part load fraction correlation (function of part load ratio) is a quadratic or cubic curve with the independent variable being part load ratio (sensible heating load / steady-state heating capacity). The output of this curve is used in combination with the rated EIR and EIR modifier curves to give the “effective” EIR for a given simulation timestep. The part load fraction correlation accounts for efficiency losses due to compressor cycling.</p>
<p>6)    The waste heat modifier curve (function of temperature) is a bi-quadratic curve with two independent variables: outdoor air dry-bulb temperature and the heating coil entering air dry-bulb temperature. The output of this curve is multiplied by the heating input energy, the waste heat fraction of heat input to give the recoverable waste heat.</p>
<p>The curves are simply specified by name. Curve inputs are described in the curve manager section of this document (ref. Performance Curves).</p>
<h4 id="field-name_49">Field: Name</h4>
<p>This alpha field defines a unique user-assigned name for an instance of a multispeed DX heating coil. Any reference to this DX heating coil by another object will use this name. The only allowed parent is AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:AirToAir:MultiSpeed.</p>
<h4 id="field-availability-schedule-name_11">Field: Availability Schedule Name</h4>
<p>This alpha field defines the name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the multispeed DX heating coil can run during a given time period. A schedule value greater than 0 (usually 1 is used) indicates that the unit can be on during the time period. A value less than or equal to 0 (usually 0 is used) denotes that the unit must be off for the time period. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.</p>
<h4 id="field-air-inlet-node-name_15">Field: Air Inlet Node name</h4>
<p>This alpha field defines the name of the HVAC system node from which the DX heating coil draws its inlet air.</p>
<h4 id="field-air-outlet-node-name_15">Field: Air Outlet Node Name</h4>
<p>This alpha field defines the name of the HVAC system node to which the DX heating coil sends its outlet air.</p>
<h4 id="field-minimum-outdoor-dry-bulb-temperature-for-compressor-operation_1">Field: Minimum Outdoor Dry-Bulb Temperature for Compressor Operation</h4>
<p>This numeric field defines the minimum outdoor air dry-bulb temperature where the heating coil compressor turns off. The temperature for this input field must be greater than or equal to –20°C. If this input field is left blank, the default value is -8°C.</p>
<h4 id="field-crankcase-heater-capacity_5">Field: Crankcase Heater Capacity</h4>
<p>This numeric field defines the crankcase heater capacity in Watts. When the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature is below the value specified in the input field “Maximum Outdoor Dry-bulb Temperature for Crankcase Heater Operation” (described below), the crankcase heater is enabled during the time that the compressor is not running. The value for this input field must be greater than or equal to 0. If this input field is left blank, the default value is 0. To simulate a unit without a crankcase heater, enter a value of 0.</p>
<h4 id="field-maximum-outdoor-dry-bulb-temperature-for-crankcase-heater-operation_5">Field: Maximum Outdoor Dry-Bulb Temperature for Crankcase Heater Operation</h4>
<p>This numeric field defines the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature above which the compressor’s crankcase heater is disabled. The value for this input field must be greater than or equal to 0.0°C. If this input field is left blank, the default value is 10°C.</p>
<h4 id="field-defrost-energy-input-ratio-function-of-temperature-curve-name_1">Field: Defrost Energy Input Ratio Function of Temperature Curve Name</h4>
<p>This alpha field defines the name of a bi-quadratic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input ratio (EIR) during reverse-cycle defrost periods as a function of the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature and the wet-bulb temperature of the air entering the indoor coil. The EIR is the inverse of the COP. The output of this curve is multiplied by the coil capacity, the fractional defrost time period and the runtime fraction of the heating coil to give the defrost power at the specific temperatures at which the indoor and outdoor coils are operating. This curve is only required when a reverse-cycle defrost strategy is selected. The curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 at the rating point conditions.</p>
<h4 id="field-maximum-outdoor-dry-bulb-temperature-for-defrost-operation_1">Field: Maximum Outdoor Dry-Bulb Temperature for Defrost Operation</h4>
<p>This numeric field defines the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature above which outdoor coil defrosting is disabled. The temperature for this input field must be greater than or equal to 0°C and less than or equal to 7.22°C. If this input field is left blank, the default value is 5°C.</p>
<h4 id="field-defrost-strategy_1">Field: Defrost Strategy</h4>
<p>This alpha field has two choices: reverse-cycle or resistive. If the reverse-cycle strategy is selected, the heating cycle is reversed periodically to provide heat to melt frost accumulated on the outdoor coil. If a resistive defrost strategy is selected, the frost is melted using an electric resistance heater. If this input field is left blank, the default defrost strategy is reverse-cycle.</p>
<h4 id="field-defrost-control_1">Field: Defrost Control</h4>
<p>This alpha field has two choices: timed or on-demand. If timed control is selected, the defrost time period is calculated based on a fixed value or compressor runtime whether or not frost has actually accumulated. For timed defrost control, the fractional amount of time the unit is in defrost is entered in the input field “Defrost Time Period Fraction” described below. If on-demand defrost control is selected, the defrost time period is calculated based on outdoor weather (humidity ratio) conditions. Regardless of which defrost control is selected, defrost does not occur above the user specified outdoor temperature entered in the input field “Maximum Outdoor Dry-bulb Temperature for Defrost Operation” described above. If this input field is left blank, the default defrost control is timed.</p>
<h4 id="field-defrost-time-period-fraction_1">Field: Defrost Time Period Fraction</h4>
<p>This numeric field defines the fraction of compressor runtime when the defrost cycle is active, and only applies to “timed” defrost (see Defrost Control input field above). For example, if the defrost cycle is active for 3.5 minutes for every 60 minutes of compressor runtime, then the user should enter 3.5/60 = 0.058333. The value for this input field must be greater than or equal to 0. If this input field is left blank, the default value is 0.058333.</p>
<h4 id="field-resistive-defrost-heater-capacity_1">Field: Resistive Defrost Heater Capacity</h4>
<p>This numeric field defines the capacity of the resistive defrost heating element in Watts. This input field is used only when the selected defrost strategy is ‘resistive’ (see input field “Defrost Strategy” above). The value for this input field must be greater than or equal to 0. If this input field is left blank, the default value is 0.</p>
<h4 id="field-apply-part-load-fraction-to-speeds-greater-than-1_1">Field: Apply Part Load Fraction to Speeds Greater than 1</h4>
<p>This field determines whether part-load impacts on coil energy use are applied when the coil is operating at speeds greater than speed 1. The allowed choices are Yes or No, with the default being No if this field is left blank. Other input fields in this object allow the user to specify a part-load fraction correlation for each speed to account for compressor start up losses (cycle on/off). For the case of a single multi-speed compressor, the part load losses may only be significant when the compressor cycles between speed 1 and off, but the losses may be extremely small when the compressor operates between speed 1 and speed 2 (or between speeds 2 and 3, etc.). In this case, the user may chose to specify <strong>No</strong> for this input field to neglect part-load impacts on energy use at higher operating speeds. If part-load impacts on coil energy use are thought to be significant (e.g., interwined cooling coil with multiple compressors feeding individual refrigerant circuits), then the user may chose to specify <strong>Yes</strong> and the part-load fraction correlations specified for speeds 2 through 4 will be applied as appropriate. The selection for this input field does not affect part-load impacts when the compressor cycles between speed 1 and off  (i.e., the part-load fraction correlation for speed 1 is always applied).</p>
<h4 id="field-fuel-type_1">Field: Fuel Type</h4>
<p>This alpha field determines the type of fuel that the chiller uses.  This field has seven choices: Electricity, NaturalGas, PropaneGas, Coal, Diesel, Gasoline, FuelOil#1, FuelOil#2, OtherFuel1 and OtherFuel2. The default is NaturalGas.</p>
<h4 id="field-number-of-speeds_2">Field: Number of Speeds</h4>
<p>This field specifies the number of sets of data being entered for rated specifications, performance curves, and waste heat specifications for each cooling speed. The rated specifications consist of gross rated capacity, gross rated COP, and rated air flow rate. The performance curves consist of a total capacity modifier curve as a function of temperature, total capacity modifier curve as a function of flow fraction, energy input ratio modifier curve as a function of temperature, energy input ratio modifier curve as a function of flow fraction, and part load fraction correlation as a function of part load ratio. The waste heat specifications include the fraction of energy input to the heating coil at the fully loaded and rated conditions, and a temperature modifier. The minimum number of speeds for heating is 2 and the maximum number is 4. The number of speeds should be the same as the number of speeds for heating defined in its parent object (AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:AirToAir:MultiSpeed). The first set of performance inputs is for Speed 1 and should be for low speed, and the last set of performance inputs should be for high speed. For example, if only three heating speeds are defined, the first set should be for low speed (Speed 1), the second set should be for medium speed (Speed 2), and the third set should be for high speed (Speed 3). In this example, any performance inputs for Speed 4 would be neglected (since this input field specifies that the coil only has three heating speeds).</p>
<h4 id="field-group-rated-specification-performance-curves-and-waste-heat-data">Field Group: Rated Specification, Performance Curves, and Waste Heat Data</h4>
<p>The performance for each heating speed must be specified as shown below. All inputs for Speed 1 are required first, followed by the inputs for Speed 2, Speed 3 and Speed 4.</p>

The value entered here must be greater than 0. The gross heating capacity should not account for the effect of supply air fan heat.</p>
<h4 id="field-speed-x-gross-rated-heating-cop">Field: Speed &lt;x&gt; Gross Rated Heating COP</h4>
<p>This numeric field defines the coefficient of performance (COP=gross heating capacity in watts divided by electrical power input in watts) of the DX heating coil unit at rated conditions for Speed &lt;x&gt; operation (outdoor air dry-bulb temperature of 8.33°C, outdoor air wet-bulb temperature of 6.11°C, coil entering air dry-bulb temperature of 21.11°C, coil entering air wet-bulb temperature of 15.55°C, and a heating coil air flow rate defined by field “Speed &lt;x&gt; Rated Air Flow Rate” below). The value entered here must be greater than 0. The input power includes power for the compressor(s) and outdoor fan(s) but does not include the power consumption of the indoor supply air fan. The gross heating capacity is the value entered above in the field “Gross Rated Heating Capacity”. The gross COP should NOT account for the supply air fan.</p>
<h4 id="field-speed-x-rated-air-flow-rate_1">Field: Speed &lt;x&gt; Rated Air Flow Rate</h4>
<p>This numeric field defines the volume air flow rate, in m<sup>3</sup> per second, across the DX heating coil at rated conditions for Speed &lt;x&gt; operation. The value entered here must be greater than 0. The rated air volume flow rate should be between 0.00004027 m<sup>3</sup>/s and 0.00006041 m<sup>3</sup>/s per watt of gross rated heating capacity. The gross rated heating capacity and gross rated COP should be performance information for the unit with outdoor air dry-bulb temperature of 8.33°C, outdoor air wet-bulb temperature of 6.11°C, heating coil entering air dry-bulb temperature of 21.11°C, heating coil entering air wet-bulb temperature of 15.55°C, and the rated air volume flow rate defined here.</p>

<p>This alpha field defines the name of a bi-quadratic, quadratic or cubic performance curve for Speed &lt;x&gt; (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the total heating capacity as a function of the both the indoor and outdoor air dry-bulb temperature or just the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature depending on the type of curve selected. The bi-quadratic curve is recommended if sufficient manufacturer data is available as it provides sensitivity to the indoor air dry-bulb temperature and a more realistic output. The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated heating capacity to give the gross total heating capacity at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at an indoor air dry-bulb temperature or outdoor air dry-bulb temperature different from the rating point temperature). The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 at the rating point.</p>
<h4 id="field-speed-x-heating-capacity-function-of-flow-fraction-curve-name">Field: Speed &lt;x&gt; Heating Capacity Function of Flow Fraction Curve Name</h4>
<p>This alpha field defines the name of a quadratic or cubic performance curve for Speed &lt;x&gt; (ref:  Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of heating capacity as a function of the ratio of actual air flow rate across the heating coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The output of this curve is multiplied by the gross rated heating capacity and the gross heating capacity modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the gross heating capacity at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the coil is operating. The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate.</p>
<h4 id="field-speed-x-energy-input-ratio-function-of-temperature-curve-name_2">Field: Speed &lt;x&gt; Energy Input Ratio Function of Temperature Curve Name</h4>
<p>This alpha field defines the name of a bi-quadratic, quadratic or cubic performance curve for Speed &lt;x&gt; (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input ratio (EIR) as a function of the both the indoor and outdoor air dry-bulb temperature or just the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature depending on the type of curve selected. The bi-quadratic curve is recommended if sufficient manufacturer data is available as it provides sensitivity to the indoor air dry-bulb temperature and a more realistic output. The EIR is the inverse of the COP. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR (inverse of rated COP) to give the EIR at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at an indoor air dry-bulb temperature or outdoor air dry-bulb temperature different from the rating point temperature). The curve is normalized to have the value of 1.0 at the rating point.</p>
<h4 id="field-speed-x-energy-input-ratio-function-of-flow-fraction-curve-name_1">Field: Speed &lt;x&gt; Energy Input Ratio Function of Flow Fraction Curve Name</h4>
<p>This alpha field defines the name of a quadratic or cubic performance curve for Speed &lt;x&gt; (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input ratio (EIR) as a function of the ratio of actual air flow rate across the heating coil to the rated air flow rate (i.e., fraction of full load flow). The EIR is the inverse of the COP. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated EIR and the EIR modifier curve (function of temperature) to give the EIR at the specific temperature and air flow conditions at which the coil is operating. This curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 when the actual air flow rate equals the rated air flow rate.</p>
<h4 id="field-speed-xpart-load-fraction-correlation-curve-name">Field: Speed &lt;x&gt;Part Load Fraction Correlation Curve Name</h4>
<p>This alpha field defines the name of a quadratic or cubic performance curve for Speed &lt;x&gt; (Ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of electrical power input to the DX unit as a function of the part load ratio (PLR, sensible cooling load/steady-state sensible cooling capacity). The product of the rated EIR and EIR modifier curves is divided by the output of this curve to give the “effective” EIR for a given simulation timestep. The part load fraction (PLF) correlation accounts for efficiency losses due to compressor cycling.</p>
<p>The part load fraction correlation should be normalized to a value of 1.0 when the part load ratio equals 1.0 (i.e., no efficiency losses when the compressor(s) run continuously for the simulation timestep). For PLR values between 0 and 1 (0 &lt;= PLR &lt; 1), the following rules apply:</p>
<p>PLF &gt;= 0.7   and   PLF &gt;= PLR</p>
<p>If PLF &lt; 0.7 a warning message is issued, the program resets the PLF value to 0.7, and the simulation proceeds. The runtime fraction of the coil is defined as PLR/PLF. If PLF &lt; PLR, then a warning message is issued and the runtime fraction of the coil is limited to 1.0.</p>
<p>A typical part load fraction correlation for a conventional DX heating coil (Speed &lt;x&gt;) would be:</p>
<p>PLF = 0.85 + 0.15(PLR)</p>
<p>If the user wishes to model no efficiency degradation due to compressor cycling, the part load fraction correlation should be defined as follows:</p>
<p>PLF = 1.0 + 0.0(PLR)</p>

<p>The name of a bi-quadratic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the waste heat recovery as a function of outdoor dry-bulb temperature and the entering coil dry-bulb temperature for Speed &lt;x&gt;. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated recoverable waste heat at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the rating point). The curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 at the rating point. When the fuel type is electricity, the field is either left blank or ignored by the program.</p>

<p>This input field is name of a conditioned or unconditioned zone where the secondary coil (evaporator) of a heat pump is installed.  This is an optional input field specified only when user desires to extract heat from the zone via secondary coil. Heat extracted is modeled as internal gain.

<p>This input value is the nominal sensible heat ratio used to split the heat extracted by a secondary DX coil (evaporator) of a heat pump into sensible and latent components.

<h4 id="field-speed-x-sensible-heat-ratio-modifier-function-of-temperature-curve-name">Field: Speed &lt;x&gt; Sensible Heat Ratio Modifier Function of Temperature Curve Name</h4>
<p>This input field is name of sensible heat ratio modifier biquadratic curve.  The value of this curve modifies the nominal sensible heat ratio for current time step depending on the secondary zone air node wet-bulb temperature and the heating DX coil entering air dry-bulb temperature.  This is an optional input field.  If this input field is left blank, then the nominal sensible heat ratio modifier curve value for temperature is set to 1.0.</p>

<h3 id="coilheatingdxvariablespeed">Coil:Heating:DX:VariableSpeed</h3>
<p>The Variable-Speed Air-to-Air Heating DX Coil is a collection of performance curves that represent the heating coil at various speed levels. The performance curves should be generated from the heat pump Reference Unit catalog data. This is an equation-fit model that resembles a black box with no usage of heat transfer equations. The number of speed levels can range from 1 to 10. The heating coil has two air side node connections. The user needs to specify a nominal speed level, at which the gross rated capacity and rated volumetric air flow rate are sized. The gross rated capacity and rated volumetric flow rate represent the real situation in the air loop, and are used to determine the flow rates at various speed levels in the parent objects, e.g. AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:AirToAir, ZoneHVAC:PackagedTerminalHeatPump, etc. It shall be mentioned that the performance correction curves, i.e. the temperature and flow fraction correction curves, should be normalized to the capacity and flow rate at each individual speed and at the rated operating conditions, similar to the performance curves used in the single-speed DX coil. On the other hand, the performance values at individual speed levels, e.g. capacities, COPs and flow rates, should be given regarding a specific unit from the Reference Unit catalog data. In the following content, the statement started with “Reference Unit” means the actual Reference Unit catalog data. The rated conditions for obtaining the capacities and COPs  are at indoor dry-bulb temperature of 21.1 ˚C (70 ˚F) and the source side entering air temperature of 8.3 ˚C (47 ˚F). Some equations are provided below to help explain the function of the various performance curves and data fields.</p>

The product of the rated EIR and EIR modifier curves is divided by the output of this curve to give the “effective” EIR for a given simulation timestep for Speed 1. The part load fraction (PLF) correlation accounts for efficiency losses due to compressor cycling. The part load fraction correlation should be normalized to a value of 1.0 when the part load ratio equals 1.0 (i.e., no efficiency losses when the compressor(s) run continuously for the simulation timestep).</p>

<p>This alpha field defines the name of a bi-quadratic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input ratio (EIR) during reverse-cycle defrost periods as a function of the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature and the wet-bulb temperature of the air entering the indoor coil. The EIR is the inverse of the COP. The output of this curve is multiplied by the coil capacity at the maximum speed level, the fractional defrost time period and the runtime fraction of the heating coil to give the defrost power at the specific temperatures at which the indoor and outdoor coils are operating. This curve is only required when a reverse cycle defrost strategy is selected. The curve is normalized to a value of 1.0 at the rating point conditions.</p>

<h4 id="field-defrost-strategy_2">Field: Defrost Strategy</h4>
<p>This alpha field has two choices: reverse-cycle or resistive. If the reverse-cycle strategy is selected, the heating cycle is reversed periodically to provide heat to melt frost accumulated on the outdoor coil. If a resistive defrost strategy is selected, the frost is melted using an electric resistance heater. If this input field is left blank, the default defrost strategy is reverse cycle.</p>
<h4 id="field-defrost-control_2">Field: Defrost Control</h4>
<p>This alpha field has two choices: timed or on-demand. If timed control is selected, the defrost time period is calculated based on a fixed value or compressor runtime whether or not frost has actually accumulated. For timed defrost control, the fractional amount of time the unit is in defrost is entered in the input field “Defrost Time Period Fraction” described below. If on-demand defrost control is selected, the defrost time period is calculated based on outdoor weather (humidity ratio) conditions. Regardless of which defrost control is selected, defrost does not occur above the user specified outdoor temperature entered in the input field “Maximum Outdoor Dry-bulb Temperature for Defrost Operation” described above. If this input field is left blank, the default defrost control is timed.</p>
<h4 id="field-defrost-time-period-fraction_2">Field: Defrost Time Period Fraction</h4>
<p>This numeric field defines the fraction of compressor runtime when the defrost cycle is active, and only applies to “timed” defrost (see Defrost Control input field above).

The value for this input field must be greater than or equal to 0. If this input field is left blank, the default value is 0.058333.</p>
<h4 id="field-resistive-defrost-heater-capacity_2">Field: Resistive Defrost Heater Capacity</h4>
<p>This numeric field defines the capacity of the resistive defrost heating element in Watts.

<h3 id="coilwaterheatingdesuperheater">Coil:WaterHeating:Desuperheater</h3>
<p>A simplified approach is used to determine the performance of this water heating coil. The model assumes that the heating energy provided by this coil is reclaimed from the superheated refrigerant gas leaving a compressor (i.e., a desuperheating refrigerant-to-water heating coil) and does not impact the performance of the compressor. This coil must be used with a water heater tank (e.g., WaterHeater:Mixed) which can supply heated potable water and/or hot water for use in a plant loop (e.g., hydronic air reheat coils).</p>
<p>Except for detailed refrigeration system models, the amount of available superheat is simply a percentage of the total heat being rejected by the DX system’s condenser. Approximately 25-30% of the energy rejected by typical refrigeration system condensers is to reduce the superheated refrigerant vapor temperature to the condensing temperature. Recovery efficiencies higher than 30% may cause the refrigerant gas to condense which in turn impacts the performance of the refrigeration system. For this reason, the maximum heat reclaim recovery efficiency for this coil is 30% for most sources of waste heat, including refrigeration compressor racks. The one exception to this 30% limit is a condenser that is part of a detailed refrigeration system. In a detailed refrigeration system, the portion of the rejected heat that lies within the superheated region is explicitly calculated. Therefore, the desuperheater coils supplied by a condenser attached to a detailed refrigeration system are subject to a maximum reclaim recovery efficiency of 90% of the heat within the superheated region.</p>
<p>The model includes the ability to modify the heat reclaim recovery efficiency based on variations in inlet water temperature and outdoor air dry-bulb temperature.</p>
<p>This coil model performs the following major functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>calculates the amount of heat delivered to the water tank</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>calculates the electricity consumption of the integral water pump and on/off-cycle parasitic loads</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The input fields for this object are described below in detail:</p>
<h4 id="field-name_51">Field: Name</h4>
<p>This alpha field contains a unique user-assigned name for an instance of a desuperheater water heating coil. Any reference to this desuperheater coil by another object will use this name.</p>
<h4 id="field-availability-schedule-name_12">Field: Availability Schedule Name</h4>
<p>This alpha field contains the name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the desuperheater coil is available to operate during a given time period. A schedule value equal to 0 denotes that the desuperheater coil is off for that time period. A value other than 0 denotes that the desuperheater coil is available to operate during that time period. During times when the desuperheater coil is scheduled off, the heater (element or burner) in the water tank object operates based on its tank set point temperature schedule and the desuperheater coil’s parasitic electric power is also off for that time period. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.</p>
<h4 id="field-setpoint-temperature-schedule-name_3">Field: Setpoint Temperature Schedule Name</h4>
<p>This alpha field contains the name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that specifies the set point (or “cut-out”) temperature for the desuperheater coil. Temperature values used in this schedule should be in degrees Celsius. The desuperheater coil turns off when the tank water reaches this set point temperature. Once the desuperheater coil is off, the tank water temperature floats downward until it falls below the set point temperature minus the dead band temperature difference defined below (i.e., the “cut-in” temperature). At this point, the desuperheater coil turns on and remains on until the desuperheater coil set point temperature is reached.</p>
<h4 id="field-dead-band-temperature-difference">Field: Dead Band Temperature Difference</h4>
<p>This numeric field contains the dead band temperature difference in degrees Celsius. The desuperheater coil “cut-in” temperature is defined as the desuperheater coil set point temperature defined above minus this dead band temperature difference. The desuperheater coil turns on when the water temperature in the tank falls below the “cut-in” temperature. The desuperheater coil remains on until the water temperature in the tank rises above the desuperheater coil set point (“cut-out”) temperature defined above. The dead band temperature difference must be greater than 0°C and less than or equal to 20°C. If this field is left blank, the default value is 5°C.</p>
<p>Desuperheater water heating coils are typically used to offset energy consumption by the water tank’s heater (element or burner). Therefore, the cut-in temperature for the desuperheater coil (set point minus dead band temperature difference) is usually higher than the set point temperature for the heater (element or burner) in the associated water heater tank object. At times when the water heater tank set point temperature is greater than the cut-in temperature of the desuperheater coil, the model disables the desuperheater coil and the tank’s heater is used to heat the water.</p>
<h4 id="field-rated-heat-reclaim-recovery-efficiency">Field: Rated Heat Reclaim Recovery Efficiency</h4>
<p>This numeric field defines the ratio of recovered waste heat from the superheated refrigerant gas to the total rejected waste heat from the heating source (as if no heat reclaim occurred). Input values must be greater than 0 up to a  maximum value is 0.3 (with a defaults of 0.25) for most sources of waste heat, including refrigeration compressor racks. The one exception to this 0.3 limit is a source that is a condenser that is part of a detailed refrigeration system. In a detailed refrigeration system, the portion of the rejected heat that lies within the superheated region is explicitly calculated. Therefore, the desuperheater coils supplied by a condenser attached to a detailed refrigeration system are subject to a maximum reclaim recovery efficiency of 0.9. with a  default value is 0.8.</p>
<h4 id="field-rated-inlet-water-temperature_1">Field: Rated Inlet Water Temperature</h4>
<p>This numeric field defines the coil inlet water temperature, in degrees Celsius, that corresponds to the rated heat reclaim recovery efficiency. Also see field “Heat Reclaim Efficiency Modifier Curve Name (function of temperature)” below.</p>
<h4 id="field-rated-outdoor-air-temperature">Field: Rated Outdoor Air Temperature</h4>
<p>This numeric field defines the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature, in degrees Celsius, that corresponds to the rated heat reclaim recovery efficiency. The outdoor air dry-bulb temperature impacts the desuperheater coil refrigerant temperature and the amount of heat available for reclaim. Also see field “Heat Reclaim Efficiency Modifier Curve Name(function of temperature)” below.</p>
<h4 id="field-maximum-inlet-water-temperature-for-heat-reclaim">Field: Maximum Inlet Water Temperature for Heat Reclaim</h4>
<p>This numeric field defines the maximum coil inlet water temperature in degrees Celsius. Any time the inlet water temperature to the desuperheater coil is above this maximum allowed temperature, heat reclaim is restricted so that the tank water does not exceed this temperature.</p>
<h4 id="field-heat-reclaim-efficiency-function-of-temperature-curve-name">Field: Heat Reclaim Efficiency Function of Temperature Curve Name</h4>
<p>This alpha field specifies the name of a bi-quadratic curve object (ref: Performance Curves) that defines the variation in heat reclaim efficiency as a function of inlet fluid (air and water) temperatures. The bi-quadratic curve uses the coil inlet water temperature and outdoor air dry-bulb temperature (entering the DX coil condenser) as the independent variables. The output of this curve is multiplied by the rated heat reclaim recovery efficiency to give the heat reclaim efficiency at specific operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the rating point temperatures). The curve should be normalized to have the value of 1.0 at the rating point temperatures. If this field is left blank, the heat reclaim efficiency remains constant (curve value assumed to be 1.0 for all conditions). The model restricts the product of the output of this curve and the rated heat reclaim recovery efficiency to a maximum of 0.9 for refrigeration condenser sources and 0.3 for all other sources..</p>
<h4 id="field-water-inlet-node-name_5">Field: Water Inlet Node Name</h4>
<p>This alpha field defines the name of the water node from which the desuperheater heating coil draws its inlet water. This node name must also match the source side outlet node name for the water heater tank used with this coil (ref. Water Heaters).</p>
<h4 id="field-water-outlet-node-name_5">Field: Water Outlet Node Name</h4>
<p>This alpha field defines the name of the water node to which the desuperheater heating coil sends its outlet water. This node name must also match the source side inlet node name for the water heater tank used with this coil (ref. Water Heaters).</p>
<h4 id="field-tank-object-type">Field: Tank Object Type</h4>
<p>This alpha (choice) field contains the type of water heater tank used by this desuperheater heating coil. Currently, the only valid choice is WaterHeater:Mixed.</p>
<h4 id="field-tank-name">Field: Tank Name</h4>
<p>This alpha field contains the name of the specific water heater tank (WaterHeater:Mixed object) used by this desuperheater heating coil.</p>
<h4 id="field-heating-source-object-type_1">Field: Heating Source Object Type</h4>
<p>This alpha (choice) field defines the source of superheated refrigerant gas from which the desuperheater water heating coil recovers energy through heat reclaim. Valid choices are:</p>

<p>This alpha field defines the name of the desuperheater coil’s heat source (e.g., the name of a specific coil of the type mentioned in the previous field which provides waste heat to this desuperheater water heating coil).</p>
<h4 id="field-water-flow-rate">Field: Water Flow Rate</h4>
<p>This numeric field defines the desuperheater coil’s water flow rate in cubic meters per second. The model assumes that this flow rate is constant (throughout the simulation period) when the desuperheater coil operates, and that it corresponds to the heat reclaim recovery efficiency performance specified by the user. This water flow rate must be greater than zero.</p>
<h4 id="field-water-pump-power">Field: Water Pump Power</h4>
<p>This numeric field defines the coil’s water circulation pump power in Watts. This is the operating pump power as installed. Values must be greater than or equal to 0. If this field is left blank, the default value is 0. A warning message will be issued if the ratio of water pump power to desuperheater water volumetric flow rate exceeds 7.9264E6 W/m<sup>3</sup>/s, but the simulation will continue using the user-defined values. The model assumes that this integral pump (i.e., no need to define a separate pump object) cycles on and off with the desuperheater heating coil.</p>
<h4 id="field-fraction-of-pump-heat-to-water">Field: Fraction of Pump Heat to Water</h4>
<p>This numeric field defines the fraction of water circulation pump heat that is transferred to the water. The pump is assumed to be downstream of the desuperheater water heating coil, and this field is used to determine the desuperheater water outlet temperature. Values must be greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 1. If this field is left blank, the default value is 0.2.</p>
<h4 id="field-on-cycle-parasitic-electric-load">Field: On-Cycle Parasitic Electric Load</h4>
<p>This optional numeric field contains the on-cycle parasitic electric power in Watts. This is the parasitic electric power consumed by controls or other electrical devices associated with the desuperheater water heating coil. This parasitic electric load is consumed whenever the desuperheater coil is operating, and the model assumes that this parasitic power does not contribute to heating the water nor does it affect the zone air heat balance. The minimum value for this field is 0.0, and the default value is also 0.0 if this field is left blank.</p>
<h4 id="field-off-cycle-parasitic-electric-load">Field: Off-Cycle Parasitic Electric Load</h4>
<p>This optional numeric field contains the off-cycle parasitic electric power in Watts. This is the parasitic electric power consumed by controls or other electrical devices associated with the desuperheater water heating coil. This parasitic electric load is consumed whenever the desuperheater coil is available but is not operating, and the model assumes that this parasitic power does not contribute to heating the water nor does it affect the zone air heat balance. The minimum value for this field is 0.0, and the default value is also 0.0 if this field is left blank.</p>

<h3 id="coilsystemcoolingdx">CoilSystem:Cooling:DX</h3>
<p>The CoilSystem:Cooling:DX object is a “virtual” container component that consists of a DX cooling coil component and its associated controls, as shown in the Figure below. This control object supports several different types of DX cooling coils (see field Cooling Coil Object Type).</p>
<p>This component may be used as a cooling coil in constant volume or variable volume systems, as blow through or draw through, with or without humidity controls. Unlike AirLoopHVAC:Unitary system types, this component controls only the DX coil, not the supply fan.  CoilSystem:Cooling:DX is added to a system by placing it in an air loop branch (see Branch object) or in an AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem:EquipmentList or in a ZoneHVAC:OutdoorAirUnit:EquipmentList . It requires one or more setpoint manager (see SetpointManager:*) objects to specify temperature and/or humidity setpoints (unless it is used in a ZoneHVAC:OutdoorAirUnit which has its own temperature setpoints).  This object is the one that is listed in the Branch or equipment list object rather than the coil itself.  A constant volume or variable volume fan is modeled separately from this cooling system. These are the only fan types allowed for this system type (ref. Fan:ConstantVolume and Fan:VariableVolume).  Cycling fan operation is not available with this model. The CoilSystem:Cooling:DX object can also be placed on dedicated outdoor air system (DOAS) airloop branches or in arloop branches where the air flow to capacity ratio range is between 100 – 300 cfm/ton. 100% DOAS DX cooling coils operate in lower flow to capacity ratio range compared to regular DX cooling coils. The CoilSystem:Cooling:DX is selected to operate in DOAS application or in low flow to capacity ratio range by specifying “YES” to the input field “Use Outdoor Air DX Cooling Coil”. If this optional input field is left blank or specified as “NO”, then the coil is modeled as regular DX cooling coil. If the CoilSystem:Cooling:DX object is in an AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem:EquipmentList or in a ZoneHVAC:OutdoorAirUnit:EquipmentList then it is treated as 100% DOAS DX cooling coil only if the choice input field “Use Outdoor Air DX Cooling Coil” is set too “YES”. All the control options of the regular DX cooling coils are available to DOAS DX coils as well. Heating DX coils in DOAS airloop operate at the same flow to capacity ratio limits as the DOAS DX cooling coils.</p>

<h4 id="field-cooling-coil-name">Field: Cooling Coil Name</h4>
<p>This alpha field contains the identifying name of the DX cooling coil.</p>
<p>As shown in the example below, correct specification of this system requires specification of the DX Cooling Coil object in addition to the CoilSystem:Cooling:DX object.</p>
<h4 id="field-dehumidification-control-type">Field: Dehumidification Control Type</h4>
<p>This alpha field contains the type of dehumidification control. The following options are valid for this field:</p>
<p><strong>None</strong> - meet sensible load only, no active dehumidification control</p>
<p><strong>MultiMode</strong> - activate enhanced dehumidification mode as needed and operate to meet the sensible load. If a sensible load exists, the system will operate to meet that sensible load and may not meet the latent load. If no sensible load exists, and Run on Latent Load = Yes, the system will operate to meet the entire latent load. This option is used to model DX equipment with a switchable option such as subcool reheat. It is valid only with Cooling coil type= Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoStageWithHumidityControlMode or CoilSystem:Cooling:DX:HeatExchangerAssisted. If the Run on Latent Load option below is set to Yes, this option may require the use of a heating coil and heating coil outlet air temperature set point manager downstream of this cooling coil to maintain the temperature set point.</p>
<p><strong>CoolReheat</strong> - cool beyond the dry-bulb setpoint as required to meet the humidity setpoint. It is valid only with Cooling coil type=Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoStageWithHumidityControlMode. This option requires the use of a heating coil and heating coil outlet air temperature set point manager downstream of this cooling coil to maintain the temperature set point.</p>
<p>The default is <strong>None</strong>. For all dehumidification controls, the max humidity setpoint on the control node is used. This must be set using a <strong>ZoneControl:Humidistat</strong> <strong>ZoneControl:Humidistat</strong> and one of:</p>
<ul>

<h4 id="field-run-on-latent-load">Field: Run on Latent Load</h4>
<p>This alpha field specifies if the unit will operate to meet a latent load as determined by the inlet node humidity ratio and the max humidity setpoint on the control node. There are two valid choices, <strong>Yes</strong> or <strong>No</strong>. If <strong>Yes</strong>, unit will run if there is a latent load. If both a sensible and latent load exist, the system will operate to maintain the temperature set point. When only a latent load exists, the system will operate to meet the humidity ratio set point and requires the use of a heating coil and heating coil outlet air temperature set point manager downstream of this cooling coil to maintain the temperature set point. If <strong>No</strong>, unit will not run if there is only a latent load. The default is <strong>No</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="coil-system-frost-control-status">Coil System Frost Control Status</h4>
<p>This is a flag indicating whether frost control is active at current time step or not.  Frost control is activated or enforced when the sensible load control requires DX cooling coil outlet air temperature below the user specified minimum temperature or when the dehumidification load control requires DX cooling coil outlet air humidity ratio below the saturation humidity ratio corresponding to the user specified minimum temperature for frost control. Frost control status of zero means no active frost control, a value of 1 or 2 indicates that frost control is active.  If frost control status is 1, then the frost control was enforced when the cooling coil is run to meet sensible load.  If the frost control status value is 2, then the control was enforced when the cooling coil is run to meet latent load. When frost control is active the DX cooling coil setpoint value is modified based on user specified limit.</p>

<p>The CoilSystem:Heating:DX object is a “virtual” container component for a DX heating coil that provides the controls needed to operate the coil.  Only single speed DX air-to-air heating coils are supported.</p>
<p>This component may be used as a heating coil in constant volume or variable volume air handlers.  It can also be used in an outside air system (by including it in an AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem:EquipmentList object)or in a zone outdoor air unit (by including it in an ZoneHVAC:OutdoorAirUnit:EquipmentList object).  This object is the one that is listed in the Branch or equipment list object rather than the coil itself.</p>
<p>The inlet and outlet nodes for the DX heat pump system are defined in the heating coil object.  The control node is always the outlet node of the coil.  This DX heat pump heating system requires that a (drybulb) temperature setpoint be placed on the outlet node using either a setpoint manager or the energy management system.  The coil is controlled to attempt to meet that setpoint using a part load ratio modeling approach.</p>

<h3 id="coilsystemcoolingdxheatexchangerassisted">CoilSystem:Cooling:DX:HeatExchangerAssisted</h3>
<p>The heat exchanger-assisted DX cooling coil is a “virtual” component consisting of a direct expansion (DX) cooling coil and an air-to-air heat exchanger as shown in Figure 139 below. The air-to-air heat exchanger pre-conditions the air entering the cooling coil, and reuses this energy to post-condition the supply air leaving the cooling coil. This heat exchange process improves the latent removal performance of the cooling coil by allowing it to dedicate more of its cooling capacity toward dehumidification (lower sensible heat ratio).</p>
<p>This compound object models the basic operation of an air-to-air heat exchanger in conjunction with a cooling coil. The heat exchanger-assisted DX cooling coil does not have an operating schedule of its own; its operating schedule is governed by the availability schedules for the DX cooling coil and the air-to-air heat exchanger. This compound object is used in place of where a DX cooling coil object would normally be used by itself.</p>
<p>To model a heat exchanger-assisted DX cooling coil, the input data file should include the following objects:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>CoilSystem:Cooling:DX:HeatExchangerAssisted object</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Air-to-air heat exchanger object (HeatExchanger:AirToAir:FlatPlate, HeatExchanger:AirToAir:SensibleAndLatent, or HeatExchanger:Desiccant:BalancedFlow)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DX cooling coil object (Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of controlling the operation of the heat exchanger, the heat exchanger is assumed to always provide its heat transfer when the associated DX cooling coil is operating and no high humidity control mechanism is specified. However, the heat exchanger’s energy transfer may be controlled (i.e., turned on and off) based on a zone air humidity level using either a humidistat (ref. AirLoopHVAC:Unitary:Furnace:HeatCool or AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool) or a humidistat and a maximum humidity set point manager to place a humidity ratio set point on the appropriate control node (ref. CoilSystem:Cooling:DX). This model may also be used with the unitary changeover bypass system and the unitary air-to-air heat pump system (ref. AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool:VAVChangeoverBypass and AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:AirToAir); however, the heat exchanger is assumed to always provide its heat transfer when the cooling coil operates and cannot be turned on and off based on a zone air humidity set point. Two zone air conditioners may also use this model for improved dehumidification. The first type is the packaged terminal heat pump (ref. ZoneHVAC:PackagedTerminalHeatPump) where the heat exchanger’s heat transfer is always active whenever the cooling coil operates. The second type is the window air conditioner (ref. ZoneHVAC:WindowAirConditioner) where the heat exchanger’s heat transfer is always active when the cooling coil operates and no high humidity control mechanism is specified, OR the heat exchanger’s heat transfer may be controlled based on zone air humidity level if a humidistat and high humidity set point manager are specified (maximum humidity ratio set point placed on the heat exchanger’s exhaust air outlet node, ref. Figure 139).</p>

<p>This alpha field defines the name of a <strong>quadratic</strong> or <strong>cubic</strong> performance curve (Ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of electrical power input to the DX unit as a function of the part load ratio (PLR, sensible cooling load/steady-state sensible cooling capacity). The product of the rated EIR and EIR modifier curves is divided by the output of this curve to give the “effective” EIR for a given simulation timestep. The part load fraction (PLF) correlation accounts for efficiency losses due to compressor cycling.</p>
<p>The part load fraction correlation should be normalized to a value of 1.0 when the part load ratio equals 1.0 (i.e., no efficiency losses when the compressor(s) run continuously for the simulation timestep). For PLR values between 0 and 1 (0 &lt;= PLR &lt; 1), the following rules apply:</p>
<p>PLF &gt;= 0.7   and   PLF &gt;= PLR</p>
<p>If PLF &lt; 0.7 a warning message is issued, the program resets the PLF value to 0.7, and the simulation proceeds. The runtime fraction of the coil is defined as PLR/PLF. If PLF &lt; PLR, then a warning message is issued and the runtime fraction of the coil is limited to 1.0.</p>
<p>A typical part load fraction correlation for a conventional, single-speed DX cooling coil (e.g., residential unit) would be:</p>
<p>PLF = 0.85 + 0.15(PLR)</p>
<p>If the user wishes to model no efficiency degradation due to compressor cycling, the part load fraction correlation should be defined as follows:</p>
<p>PLF = 1.0 + 0.0(PLR)</p>

<h3 id="coilcoolingwatertoairheatpumpvariablespeedequationfit">Coil:Cooling:WaterToAirHeatPump:VariableSpeedEquationFit</h3>
<p>The Variable-Speed Water-to-Air Cooling Equation Fit Coil is a collection of performance curves that represent the cooling coil at various speed levels. The performance curves should be generated from the heat pump Reference Unit data. This is an equation-fit model that resembles a black box with no usage of heat transfer equations. On the other hand, the model uses the bypass factor approach to calculate sensible heat transfer rate, similar to the one used in the single-speed DX coil. The number of speed levels can range from 2 to 10. The cooling coil has four node connections, i.e. two air sides and two water sides. The user needs to specify a nominal speed level, at which the gross rated total cooling capacity, rated volumetric air and water flow rates are sized. The rated capacity, rated volumetric flow rates represent the real situation in the air and water loops, and are used to determine and flow rates at various speed levels in the parent objects, e.g. AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:WaterToAir and ZoneHVAC:WaterToAirHeatPump. It shall be mentioned that the performance correction curves, i.e. the temperature and flow fraction correction curves, should be normalized to the capacity and flow rates at each individual speed and at the rated conditions, similar to the performance curves used in the DX coils. However, the performance values, e.g. gross capacities, gross COPs, gross SHRs and flow rates at individual speed levels, should be given regarding a specific unit from the Reference Unit catalog data. In the following content, the statement started with “Reference Unit” means the actual Reference Unit catalog data. The rated conditions for obtaining the capacities, COPs and SHRs  are at indoor dry-bulb temperature of 26.67 ˚C (80 ˚F), wet bulb temperature of 19.44 ˚C (67 ˚F),  and the source side entering water temperature of 29.4 ˚C (85 ˚F). Some equations are provided below to help explain the function of the various performance curves and data fields.

<h4 id="field-part-load-fraction-correlation-curve-name_9">Field: Part Load Fraction Correlation Curve Name</h4>
<p>This alpha field defines the name of a quadratic or cubic performance curve (Ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of electrical power input to the unit as a function of the part load ratio (PLR, sensible or latent load/steady-state sensible or latent cooling capacity for Speed 1), in the case that the unit operates under the lowest speed, i.e. on/off. The product of the rated EIR and EIR modifier curves is divided by the output of this curve to give the “effective” EIR for a given simulation timestep for Speed 1. The part load fraction (PLF) correlation accounts for efficiency losses due to compressor cycling. The part load fraction correlation should be normalized to a value of 1.0 when the part load ratio equals 1.0 (i.e., no efficiency losses when the compressor(s) run continuously for the simulation timestep). For PLR values between 0 and 1 (0 &lt;= PLR &lt; 1), the following rules apply:</p>
<p>PLF &gt;= 0.7 and PLF &gt;= PLR</p>
<p>If PLF &lt; 0.7, the program resets the PLF value to 0.7, and the simulation proceeds. The runtime fraction of the coil is defined as PLR/PLF. If PLF &lt; PLR, the runtime fraction of the coil is limited to 1.0. A typical part load fraction correlation would be:</p>
<div>\[PLF = 0.85 + 0.15 \times PLR\]</div>

<p>If the user wishes to model no efficiency degradation due to compressor cycling, the part load fraction correlation should be defined as follows:</p>
<div>\[PLF = 0.85 + 0.0 \times PLR\]</div>

<p>The Variable-Speed Water-to-Air Heating Equation Fit Coil is a collection of performance curves that represent the heating coil at various speed levels. The performance curves should be generated from the heat pump Reference Unit catalog data. This is an equation-fit model that resembles a black box with no usage of heat transfer equations. The number of speed levels can range from 2 to 10. The heating coil has four node connections, i.e. two air sides and two water sides. The user needs to specify a nominal speed level, at which the rated capacity, rated volumetric air and water flow rates are sized. The rated capacity, rated volumetric flow rates represent the real situation in the air and water loops, and are used to determine the flow rates at various speed levels in the parent objects, e.g. AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:WaterToAir and ZoneHVAC:WaterToAirHeatPump. It shall be mentioned that the performance correction curves, i.e. the temperature and flow fraction correction curves, should be normalized to the capacity and flow rates at each individual speed and at the rated operating conditions, similar to the performance curves used in the DX coils. On the other hand, the performance values at individual speed levels, e.g. capacities, COPs and flow rates, should be given regarding a specific unit from the Reference Unit catalog data.

<h4 id="field-part-load-fraction-correlation-curve-name_10">Field: Part Load Fraction Correlation Curve Name</h4>
<p>This alpha field defines the name of a quadratic or cubic performance curve (Ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of electrical power input to the unit as a function of the part load ratio (PLR, heating load/steady-state heating capacity for Speed 1), in the case that the unit operates under the lowest speed, i.e. on/off. The product of the rated EIR and EIR modifier curves is divided by the output of this curve to give the “effective” EIR for a given simulation timestep for Speed 1. The part load fraction (PLF) correlation accounts for efficiency losses due to compressor cycling. The part load fraction correlation should be normalized to a value of 1.0 when the part load ratio equals 1.0 (i.e., no efficiency losses when the compressor(s) run continuously for the simulation timestep). For PLR values between 0 and 1 (0 &lt;= PLR &lt; 1), the following rules apply:</p>
<p>PLF &gt;= 0.7 and PLF &gt;= PLR</p>
<p>If PLF &lt; 0.7, the program resets the PLF value to 0.7, and the simulation proceeds. The runtime fraction of the coil is defined as PLR/PLF. If PLF &lt; PLR, the runtime fraction of the coil is limited to 1.0. A typical part load fraction correlation would be:</p>
<div>\[PLF = 0.85 + 0.15 \times PLR\]</div>

<p>If the user wishes to model no efficiency degradation due to compressor cycling, the part load fraction correlation should be defined as follows:</p>
<div>\[PLF = 0.85 + 0.0 \times PLR\]</div>

<h3 id="coilcoolingdxsinglespeedthermalstorage">Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed:ThermalStorage</h3>
<p>This object models a special direct expansion (DX) cooling coil that includes methods of storing thermal energy within the cooling coil package.  This packaged thermal storage cooling coil model includes all of the equipment needed to charge and discharge and the Thermal Energy Storage (TES) tank itself.  This coil object is used with CoilSystem:Cooling:DX object and a constant volume supply fan, but all other subcomponents are contained within the package.</p>
<p>Some types of devices may have a process air cooling section that actually has two coils, one an evaporator and the second some other kind of coil that cools by discharging the TES tank.  There may also be two separate heat engines inside the package with two compressors.  The model wraps these complexities inside of the model which considers just one process air cooling section that combines both types of coils and one heat rejection condenser section that rejects heat from both engines.  The operating modes that are likely to have two heat engines offer dual sets of rating points and performance curves to model the energy and capacity implications separately.</p>
<p>The model offers various modes of operation that can be controlled over time using either a schedule or EMS actuators.  The user can choose which of the five operating modes are present in the device.  Each of the modes has its own separate set of performance characteristics and curves and the model can change abruptly from one mode to the next.  For example when using the schedule control, the TES coil can be put into Charge Only Mode for some number of hours at night, operated in Cooling Only Mode during the mild morning hours, and run in Discharge Only Mode during the hottest part of the day.  Custom control routines can be programmed using EMS to obtain a dynamic, supervisory control algorithm.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Off Mode.  This mode is always present.  Although the coil will not do any cooling, the state of the TES tank is still modeled since it can continue to exchange heat with the surrounding ambient air.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cooling Only Mode.  This mode is where the coil cools air at the evaporator using a model that is very similar to the regular, single speed DX cooling coil.  The same five performance curves are used to describe cooling capacity and electric power use.  The sensible heat ratio is described using two performance curves in the same as is available for 100% outdoor air coils. The TES tank is neither charged or discharged but it continues to exchange heat with the surrounding ambient air.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cooling And Charge Mode.  This mode is where the coil both cools air at the evaporator and cools the TES tank at the same time.  The model supports separate performance characteristics when there two separate heat engines, one for evaporator cooling and one for charging the TES tank.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cooling and Discharge Mode.  This mode is where the coil cools process air and heat is rejected to both the condenser section and the TES tank at the same time. The model supports separate performance characteristics when there two separate heat engines, one for evaporator cooling and one for TES cooling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Charge Only Mode.  This mode is where the coil charges the TES tank but does not provide any cooling at the process air cooling section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discharge Only Mode.  This mode is where the coil cools process air by discharging the TES tank.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This cooling coil can be autosized.  The cooling capacity for the cooling only mode is sized to meet the air system’s final design cooling capacity.  The cooling capacity for the other modes, and the storage capacity, can all be scaled relative to that one capacity using sizing factors that can be input by the user.</p>
<h4 id="field-name_63">Field:  Name</h4>
<p>A unique name for this TES coil object, assigned by user.</p>
<h4 id="field-availability-schedule-name_15">Field:  Availability Schedule Name</h4>
<p>The name of a schedule that determines whether the TES coil is available for cooling during a given time period.  A schedule value greater than 0 (usually 1 is used) indicates that the unit can be on during a given time period.  A value less than or equal to 0 (usually 0 is used) denotes that unit must be in “off” mode.  If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.</p>
<h4 id="field-operating-mode-control-method">Field:  Operating Mode Control Method</h4>
<p>This field determines how the TES coil is to be controlled in terms of which operating mode is in effect for a given time period.  There are two choices, “ScheduledModes” or “EMSControlled.”  Choosing ScheduledModes indicates that the operating mode is determined by the values in a schedule that is named in the following input field.  Choosing EMSControlled indicates that the operating mode is determined by the state of an EMS actuator called “Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed:ThermalStorage” with the control type “Operating Mode.”</p>
<h4 id="field-operation-mode-control-schedule-name">Field:  Operation Mode Control Schedule Name</h4>
<p>This field is used (and required) if the operating model control method is set to ScheduledModes in the previous input field.  The control schedule consists of a series of integer values that indicate what mode the TES coil should operate in for a given time period. The values for various operating modes have been programmed to be as follows:</p>
<p>0.    Off Mode</p>
<p>1.    Cooling Only Mode</p>
<p>2.    Cooling And Charge Mode</p>
<p>3.    Cooling And Discharge Mode</p>
<p>4.    Charge Only Mode</p>
<p>5.    Discharge Only Mode</p>
<h4 id="field-storage-type">Field:  Storage Type</h4>
<p>This field is used to determine what type of material is used for thermal storage.  There are two basic types of thermal storage material, fluid or ice.  For fluid tanks, the material can be water or a user-defined fluid such as a glycol and the storage of thermal energy accompanies changes in the temperature of the fluid in the tank.  For ice tanks, the material is water ice and the storage of thermal energy accompanies changes in the fraction of ice.  This input field has three possible choices:  <strong>Water</strong>, <strong>UserDefinedFluidType</strong>, Or <strong>Ice</strong>.  Choose <strong>Water</strong> for a fluid tank TES based on water.  Choose <strong>UserDefinedFluidType</strong> for a fluid tank TES based on custom or glycol type fluid.  Choose <strong>Ice</strong> for ice-based TES tank.</p>
<h4 id="field-user-defined-fluid-type">Field:  User Defined Fluid Type</h4>
<p>This field is used to declare what type of user defined fluid is contained in the TES tank.  This input field is only used (and required) if the previous field is set to “UserDefinedFluidType.” Water, EthyleneGlycol, and PropoleneGlycol have fluid properties built-in to EnergyPlus.  Using a FluidProperties:GlycolConcentration object allows specifying a mixture of water and a glycol and the name of one can be entered here.  For other types of fluids, a complete set of fluid property data is needed, see FluidProperties:Name, FluidProperties:Temperature, etc.</p>
<h4 id="field-fluid-storage-volume-m3">Field:  Fluid Storage Volume [m<sup>3</sup>]</h4>
<p>This field is used to describe the size of fluid-based TES tank, in m<sup>3</sup>.  The storage volume can be automatically calculated based on the cooling capacity and sizing factor.</p>
<h4 id="field-ice-storage-capacity-gj">Field:  Ice Storage Capacity [GJ]</h4>
<p>This field is used to describe the size of ice-based TES tank, in GJ.  The storage capacity can be automatically calculated based on the cooling capacity and a sizing factor.</p>
<h4 id="field-storage-capacity-sizing-factor-hr">Field:  Storage Capacity Sizing Factor [hr]</h4>
<p>This field is used if one of the previous two fields is set to autocalculate.  The value entered here is a time duration, in hours.  This time period is used for calculating a storage capacity.  The basic idea is that storage be sized such that the TES can provide cooling at rated capacity for this amount of time.  The rated capacity used in the sizing calculation is the Discharge Only Mode Rated Storage Discharging Capacity unless the Discharge Only mode is not available in which case it is the Cooling Only Mode Rated Total Evaporator Cooling Capacity.  This sizing factor approach allows scaling the storage size relative to the TES coil’s capacity.  The sizing factor is applied for an ice-based TES by simply multiplying the rated capacity by the time duration (converted to seconds).  For fluid-based TES, a change in fluid temperature of 10°C is assumed to calculate the tank volume.</p>
<h4 id="field-storage-tank-ambient-temperature-node-name">Field:  Storage Tank Ambient Temperature Node Name</h4>
<p>This field is used to assign the environmental conditions surrounding the TES coil.  The thermal storage tank exchanges heat with its surroundings and the boundary conditions for those surrounding are taken from this node named in this field. Typically this is the name of a node declared to be an outdoor air node.  This field is required.</p>
<h4 id="field-storage-tank-to-ambient-u-value-times-area-heat-transfer-coefficient-wk">Field:  Storage Tank to Ambient U-value Times Area Heat Transfer Coefficient [W/K]</h4>
<p>This field is used to characterize the rate at which heat is exchanged between the TES tank and the surrounding ambient conditions, in W/K.  This is an overall “UA” value for the tank where the U-factor and surface area are combined into one coefficient.  Heat loss or gain to the TES tank is modeled using <span>$\dot Q = {\left( {UA} \right)<em>{Tank}}\left( {{T</em>{TES}} - {T_{Amb}}} \right)$</span>. This field is required.</p>
<h4 id="field-fluid-storage-tank-rating-temperature-c">Field:  Fluid Storage Tank Rating Temperature [C]</h4>
<p>This field is used to define what temperature is used for rating conditions when using a fluid storage tank.  This field is only used for Storage Type of Water or UserDefinedFluidType.  The temperature here is used for declaring the state of the TES fluid tank that corresponds to “Rated” conditions.  The temperature entered here is used to define fluid properties and to characterize the performance curves that depend on the state of the TES.</p>
<h4 id="field-rated-evaporator-air-flow-rate-m3s">Field:  Rated Evaporator Air Flow Rate [m<sup>3</sup>/s]</h4>
<p>This field is the air volume flow rate through the coil, in m<sup>3</sup>/s, at rating conditions.  This is the rated air flow rate through the evaporator (and any other air cooling devices that are in series with the main evaporator).  The coil can be operated with a different flow rate than this rated flow rate and the performance of the unit scales accordingly using the curves that are of the type “Function of Flow Fraction Curve.”  All of the other “rated” values for capacity, COP, and SHR values, for all the various modes, should be determined at the same air flow rate used here.  This field can be autosized.</p>
<h4 id="field-evaporator-air-inlet-node-name_2">Field:  Evaporator Air Inlet Node Name</h4>
<p>This field is the name of an HVAC system node that the coil draws in as its inlet air.  This for the evaporator’s connection to air system but it may include other air cooling devices that are in series with the evaporator and contained within the packaged TES coil. This node must be unique across the model. This field is required.</p>
<h4 id="field-evaporator-air-outlet-node-name_1">Field:  Evaporator Air Outlet Node Name</h4>
<p>This field is the name of an HVAC system node that the coils sends its outlet air.  This for the evaporator’s connection to air system but it may include other air cooling devices that are in series with the evaporator and contained within the packaged TES coil.  This node must be unique across the model. This field is required.</p>
<h4 id="field-cooling-only-mode-available">Field:  Cooling Only Mode Available</h4>
<p>This field is used to indicate if the packaged TES coil includes a mode with only cooling and no equipment is interacting with TES tank to charge or discharge it.  The choices are “Yes” or “No.” This field is required.</p>

This field is required if Cooling Only Mode is available or if another operating mode’s capacity, or storage capacity, will be autocalculated from this value.  This field is autosizable.</p>
<h4 id="field-cooling-only-mode-rated-sensible-heat-ratio">Field:  Cooling Only Mode Rated Sensible Heat Ratio</h4>
<p>This field is used to specify the sensible heat ratio (SHR) at rating conditions while operating in Cooling Only Mode.  SHR is the sensible cooling capacity divided by the total (sensible plus latent) cooling capacity and is dimensionless.  The rating conditions are air entering the cooling coil at 26.7°C drybulb, 19.4°C wetbulb, air entering the outdoor condenser section at 35°C drybulb and 23.9°C wetbulb, and cooling coil air flow rate specified in Rated Evaporator Air Flow Rate.  Both the sensible and total cooling capacities used to define the rated SHR should be gross and not include supply fan heat.  The packaged TES coil model uses SHR curves to modify the rated SHR as conditions move away from the rating conditions. This field is only used if Cooling Only Mode is available. If this input is left blank, the default is 0.7.</p>
<h4 id="field-cooling-only-mode-rated-cop">Field:  Cooling Only Mode Rated COP</h4>

<h3 id="secondary-coils-of-dx-system-and-heat-pump">Secondary Coils of DX System and Heat Pump</h3>
<p>Secondary Coils reject to or remove heat from a secondary zone as part of a DX system or an air-to-air heat pump. Secondary coil refers to a condenser of a DX system or a heat pump in cooling operating mode or an evaporator of a heat pump in heating mode. The secondary coil (e.g. condenser) of DX system or heat pumps is commonly installed outdoor but when installed inside a zone either heat is dumped to or extracted from a secondary zone. A secondary zone is a conditioned or unconditioned zone where the secondary coil is installed. Secondary coils are not standalone DX coils but they are add-on features on existing DX coil objects. A secondary DX coil is modelled by specifying additional inputs in one of the following DX coil objects: Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed, Coil:Heating:DX:SingleSpeed, Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoSpeed, Coil:Cooling:DX:MultiSpeed, and Coil:Heating:DX:MultiSpeed. These additional inputs allow us to model the heat rejected or extracted by the secondary coil while the primary (active) coil is serving another controlled zone as shown in <a href="#SecondaryCoilsFigure1">Figure</a>.  A secondary coil is not controlled directly but responds to the requirements of the primary DX coil. Heat is rejected or extracted depending on the primary DX coil operating modes.  For instance, heat rejected to a secondary zone by a condenser of a DX system or a heat pump is considered as sensible only whereas the energy extracted from a secondary zone may contain sensible and latent components.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../InputOutputReference/media/image903.png" /></p>
<p>Figure: Schematic of DX System and heat pump in cooling operating mode <a name="SecondaryCoilsFigure1"></a></p>
<p>Heat rejected or extracted by the secondary DX coil installed in a secondary zone is estimated from the DX coil models and it is considered as internal gains of the secondary zone. The capacity and electric power input of the DX system and heat pumps are determined from the operating modes of the primary cooling or heating DX coils. Calculation of a secondary coil tracks the operating modes of the primary DX coil serving the primary conditioned zone(s). Currently allowed DX coil models are single speed, two speed and multi speed DX Systems and Heat Pumps.  To model secondary DX coils the condenser type should be AirCooled.  There is no need to specify the condenser air inlet node. The model uses zone air node as the secondary coil air inlet node. And the fuel type in multispeed DX coils should Electricity.</p>
<p><strong>Cooling Operating Mode</strong>: the primary DX cooling coil of a DX system serving a primary zone is active and heat is rejected by the secondary coil (condenser) into a secondary zone. The secondary zone name is specified in DX cooling coil objects.  This operating mode applies to a DX cooling system and cooling operating mode of air-to-air single and multi-speed heat pumps. Heat rejected by a secondary coil (condenser) calculated at each time step becomes internal gain of the secondary zone as shown in <a href="#SecondaryCoilsFigure2">Figure</a>. Whenever a secondary zone name is specified in DX cooling coil objects, the secondary DX coil model calculation is invoked.  New input field required as add-on to the DX cooling coil objects is a zone name for the secondary coil (condenser) placement. </p>
<h4 id="field-zone-name-for-condenser-placement_3">Field: Zone Name for Condenser Placement</h4>
<p>This input field is name of a conditioned or unconditioned zone where the secondary coil (condenser) of DX system or a heat pump is to be placed.  This is an optional input field specified only when user desires to reject the condenser heat into a zone.  The heat rejected is modeled as sensible internal gain of a secondary zone. </p>

<p><strong>Heating Operating Mode</strong>: When a heat pump operates in heating mode then energy is extracted from the secondary zone.  Total energy extracted from a secondary zone may contain sensible and latent components.  The secondary coil (evaporator) model checks for the coil inlet and outlet air condition to determine if dehumidification has occurred. The sensible and latent split of the energy extracted is done using a user specified rated sensible heat ratio (SHR) and SHR modifier curves for temperature and secondary air flow fraction.  If the coil operation is dry, then the SHR is set to 1.0.  In addition, the model assumes that condensed water is drained to the outside. If defrosting operation is on, then the defrosting melts the frost and the liquid water from the collecting pan is drained to the outside.  Thus, defrosting energy is not included in the zone energy balance. New input fields required in the single speed DX heating coils include:</p>
<h4 id="field-zone-name-for-evaporator-placement_2">Field: Zone Name for Evaporator Placement</h4>
<p>This input field is name of a conditioned or unconditioned zone where the secondary coil (evaporator) of a heat pump is installed.  This is an optional input field specified only when user desires to extract heat from the zone via secondary coil. Heat extracted is modeled as internal gain. If the primary DX system is a heat pump, then the zone name should be the same as the zone name specified for placing the secondary cooling DX coil.</p>
<h4 id="field-speed-secondary-coil-air-flow-rate">Field: Speed <x> Secondary Coil Air Flow Rate</h4>
<p>This input value is the secondary coil (evaporator) air flow rate when the heat pump is working in heating mode or the secondary coil (condenser) air flow rate when the heat pump is working in cooling mode. This input field is auto-sizable.  </p>
<h4 id="field-speed-secondary-coil-fan-flow-scaling-factor">Field: Speed <x> Secondary Coil Fan Flow Scaling Factor</h4>
<p>This input field is scaling factor for autosizing the secondary DX coil fan flow rate.  The secondary air flow rate is determined by multiplying the primary DX coil rated air flow rate by the fan flow scaling factor.  Default value is 1.25. If the secondary coil fan flow rate is not autosized, then the secondary coil fan flow scaling factor is set to 1.0.</p>
<h4 id="field-speed-nominal-sensible-heat-ratio-of-secondary-coil">Field: Speed <x> Nominal Sensible Heat Ratio of Secondary Coil</h4>
<p>This input value is the nominal sensible heat ratio used to split the heat extracted by a secondary DX coil (evaporator) of a heat pump into sensible and latent components.  This is an optional input field.  If this input field is left blank, then pure sensible internal heat gain is assumed, i.e., sensible heat ratio of 1.0. </p>
<h4 id="field-speed-sensible-heat-ratio-modifier-function-of-temperature-curve-name">Field: Speed <x> Sensible Heat Ratio Modifier Function of Temperature Curve Name</h4>
<p>This input field is name of sensible heat ratio modifier biquadratic curve.  The value of this curve modifies the nominal sensible heat ratio for current time step depending on the secondary zone air node wet-bulb temperature and the heating DX coil entering air dry-bulb temperature.  This is an optional input field.  If this input field is left blank, then the nominal sensible heat ratio modifier curve value for temperature is set to 1.0.</p>
<h4 id="field-speed-sensible-heat-ratio-modifier-function-of-flow-fraction-curve-name">Field: Speed <x> Sensible Heat Ratio Modifier Function of Flow Fraction Curve Name</h4>
<p>This input field is name of sensible heat ratio modifier curve as function of secondary air flow fraction. The value of this curve modifies the nominal sensible heat ratio for current time step depending on the secondary coil air flow fraction. This is an optional input field.  If this input field is left blank, then the sensible heat ratio modifier curve value for flow fraction is set to 1.0.</p>

<h3 id="fanzoneexhaust">Fan:ZoneExhaust</h3>
<p>This fan object differs from the other fans in that it stands on its own in a zone rather than serving as one part of an HVAC air system.  This object appears directly in a ZoneHVAC:EquipmentList object and all the controls are contained within the fan object.  The zone exhaust fan model provides a way to include the electrical power used by the fan.  It can also impact air flows in central air handlers by decreasing the flow of return air and sometimes increasing the outdoor air flow rate.</p>
<p>There are several control options available for the exhaust fan including:  an on/off availability schedule, interaction with system availability managers, minimum zone air temperature control limits and a variable flow fraction schedule.</p>
<p>The way in which the exhaust fan impacts central air system can be controlled by declaring what portion of the flow has been “balanced” by simple airflow from infiltration, ventilation, or mixing.  However it is important to note that presence of an exhaust fan does not by itself drive any simple airflow such as infiltration, ventilation, or zone mixing.  There is no comprehensive automatic mass balancing between air system flows, exhaust flows, and the separate simple airflows.  For balancing, the simple airflows need to have their own input objects that need to be coordinated with the exhaust fan.</p>

If if is not used then the exhaust fan is assumed to be integrated with the central air handler’s system availability manager.  This field can be used to control if the exhaust fan should operate independently or not.  For example, when a night cycle availability manager turns on the central air system for freeze protection, this field can be used to control if the zone exhaust fans should also run at the same time or not.  The key choice “Coupled” indicates that the exhaust fan should be integrated with the system availability manager so that the fan runs when the air system is forced to run.   The key choice “Decoupled” indicates that the exhaust fan should operate on its own and ignore the system availability manager’s requests so that the exhaust fan can remain off when the air system runs.  The default is Coupled.</p>
<h4 id="field-minimum-zone-temperature-limit-schedule-name">Field: Minimum Zone Temperature Limit Schedule Name</h4>
<p>This field is optional. If it is not used then there will be no temperature-related control over the operation of the exhaust fan.  If the field is used, then enter the name of a schedule with values for zone temperature values (°C).  The fan’s control will be based on a comparison between the current zone air temperature and the schedule values.  If the zone is warmer than the scheduled limit, then the fan will operate.  When balancing with simple ventilation, this feature can be used to coordinate exhaust fan operation with ZoneVentilation:* controls for minimum indoor temperature.</p>
<h4 id="field-balanced-exhaust-fraction-schedule-name">Field: Balanced Exhaust Fraction Schedule Name</h4>
<p>This field is optional.  If it is not used, then all the exhaust air flow is assumed to be unbalanced by any simple airflows, such as infiltration, ventilation, or zone mixing.  Unbalanced exhaust is then modeled as being provided by the outdoor air system in the central air system. The modeling of unbalanced will reduce the flow rates at the zone’s return air node by the flow rate that is being exhausted and will insure that the outdoor air flow rate is sufficient to serve the exhaust.  If this field is used, then enter the name of a schedule with fractional values between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive.  This fraction is applied to the exhaust fan flow rate and the model tracks the portion of the exhaust that is “balanced.”  Balanced exhaust is then modeled as being provided by simple airflows and does not impact the central air system return air or outdoor air flow rates.  For example, if a kitchen zone with an exhaust fan is designed to draw half of its make up air from a neighboring dining room and the other half from the outdoor air system, then a schedule value of 0.5 could be used here.</p>

<p>These two output variables are available when the exhaust fan uses the input field called Balanced Exhaust Fraction Schedule Name.  The balanced air flow is the result of the current flow rate times the balance fraction.  The unbalanced air flow is the difference between the current flow rate and the balanced flow rate.  These outputs are the resulting flow rates in kg/s.</p>

<p>This object is used for specifying an alternate set of performance parameters for a fan. These alternate parameters are used when a system manager (such as <em>AvailabilityManager:NightVentilation</em>) sets a specified flow rate for a central forced air system. At this time, it can be used with Fan:ConstantVolume, Fan:VariableVolume, Fan:ZoneExhaust, and , Fan:OnOff fans, but not with Fan:ComponentModel fans. The fan model checks whether a fixed flow rate has been set; if it has the fan model will use these alternate performance parameters. Note that it is assumed that the fan will run at a fixed speed in the alternate mode.

<p>The required numeric outlet area of the fan (<em>A<sub>fan,out</sub></em>, m<sup>2</sup>). This value is determined from manufacturer’s data. It is used to convert fan total pressure rise to fan static pressure rise.

<div>\[{\varphi_{\max }} = \frac{{30}}{{\pi D_{fan}^3}}*\max \left( {\frac{{{Q_{fan}}}}{{{\omega_{fan}}}}} \right)\]</div>

<p><em>φ<sub>max</sub></em> occurs at minimum <em>Eu</em>, which corresponds to maximum speed (high flow) with zero pressure rise. The factor (<em>30/π</em>) converts revolutions per minute (rpm) to rad/s. Must be greater than zero.</p>
<h4 id="field-motor-fan-pulley-ratio">Field: Motor Fan Pulley Ratio</h4>
<p>The numeric dimensionless ratio of the motor pulley diameter to the fan pulley diameter (<em>D<sub>motor,pulley</sub> / D<sub>fan,pulley</sub></em>). If specified, must be greater than zero.

<p>The output of this curve is used to calculate the duct static pressure set point at each time step. This curve should be valid for the range of duct static pressure set points and volumetric flows, anticipated for the simulation period.</p>
<p>For an ad hoc linear duct static pressure reset scheme, the relation (ref: Curve:Linear in Performance Curves) between duct static pressure (<em>P<sub>sm</sub></em>, Pa) and flow through the fan (<em>Q<sub>fan</sub></em>, m<sup>3</sup>/s) for <em>Q<sub>fan,min</sub></em> ≤ <em>Q<sub>fan</sub></em> ≤ <em>Q<sub>fan,max</sub></em> is:</p>

In this region, <em>x<sub>fan</sub></em>&lt;=0.</p>
<p>The output of this curve is used to calculate the fan efficiency <em>η<sub>fan</sub></em> (<em>x<sub>fan</sub></em>) at each time step by modifying <em>η<sub>fan,max</sub></em> (see <em>Maximum Fan Static Efficiency</em> field).

If “Rated Gas Use Rate” in the field above is not autosized and the Inlet Water Temperature Option input field selected is FixedInletWaterTemperature, then the thermal efficiency specified will be ignored in the calculation, or else if the Inlet Water Temperature Option input field is specified as VariableInletWaterTemperature, then the user specified thermal efficiency value will be overridden using internally calculated matching the capacity, rated gas use rate specified and design condition defined for sizing calculation.</p>
<h4 id="field-thermal-efficiency-modifier-curve-name">Field: Thermal Efficiency Modifier Curve Name</h4>
<p>This is thermal efficiency modifier curve name of unit. This curve is normalized, i.e., the curve output value at rated condition is 1.0. If this input field is blank, then constant efficiency value specified in the input field above will be used.  Allowed thermal efficiency modifier curve types are linear, quadratic, or cubic.  These curves are solely a function of part load ratio.</p>
<h4 id="field-rated-fan-power_1">Field: Rated Fan Power</h4>
<p>The nominal full capacity electric power input to the blower fan in Watts. If no blower fan is required to inject the dry steam to the supply air stream, then this input field is set to zero.</p>
<h4 id="field-auxiliary-electric-power">Field: Auxiliary Electric Power</h4>
<p>The auxiliary electric power input in watts. This amount of power will be consumed whenever the unit is available (as defined by the availability schedule). This electric power is used for control purpose only.</p>
<h4 id="field-air-inlet-node-name_29">Field: Air Inlet Node Name</h4>
<p>The name of the HVAC system node from which the unit draws inlet air.</p>

<p>The name of the HVAC system node to which the unit sends its outlet air.</p>
<h4 id="field-water-storage-tank-name_1">Field: Water Storage Tank Name</h4>
<p>This field is optional. If left blank or omitted, then the humidifier obtains its water directly from the mains water. If the name of a Water Storage Tank is specified, then the humidifier will try to obtain its water from that tank. If the tank can’t provide all the water then the rest will be drawn from the mains and the humidifier will still operate.</p>
<h4 id="field-inlet-water-temperature-option">Field: Inlet Water Temperature Option</h4>
<p>This field is a key/choice field that tells which humidifier water inlet temperature to use: fixed inlet temperature or variable water inlet temperature that depends on the source. Currently allowed water sources are main water or water storage tank in water use objects. The key/choice are: FixedInletWaterTemperature, with this choice, the gas fired humidifier will use a fixed 20C water inlet temperature. VariableInletWaterTemperature, with this choice, the gas fired humidifier will use water inlet temperature that depends on the source temperature. If a water use storage tank name is specified, then the gas humidifier water inlet temperature will be the storage water temperature, or else it uses water main temperature. The default main water temperature is 10°C. If left blank or omitted, then the humidifier assumes fixed inlet water temperature of 20°C.</p>

<p>This object models a solid desiccant dehumidifier (excluding associated fans). The process air stream is the air which is dehumidified. The regen air stream is the air which is heated to regenerate the desiccant. This object determines the process air outlet conditions, the load on the regeneration heating coil, the electric power consumption for the wheel rotor motor, and the regeneration air fan mass flow rate. All other heat exchangers are modeled as separate objects connected to the inlet and outlet nodes of the dehumidifier. The solid desiccant dehumidifier is typically used in an AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem object, but can also be specified in any AirLoopHVAC. The regeneration heating coil can be Gas, Electric, Steam , or Hot Water coil.  When hot water coil is selected as regeneration heating coil user-defined curves designed for lower temperature operation must be specified in the input field Performance Model Type along with the Nominal Regeneration Temperature input field.

<p>The Dehumidifier:Desiccant:System object models the dehumidification of an air stream, normally called the process air stream. A second heated air stream, called the regeneration air stream, is used to remove the collected moisture from the desiccant heat exchanger and this moisture-laden air is then usually exhausted from the building. This Dehumidifier:Desiccant:System object is similar to the Dehumidifier:Desiccant:NoFans object but has some additional modeling capabilities.</p>
<p>The Dehumidifier:Desiccant:System object in EnergyPlus is a compound object that can be placed anywhere in an air loop (AirLoopHVAC). Common locations for this object are in an AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem or in the main air loop (AirLoopHVAC) downstream of a cooling coil (postcooling desiccant dehumidifier). This compound object coordinates the operation of several ‘children’ objects: a desiccant heat exchanger, a regeneration air fan, and an optional regeneration air heater. Gas, Electric, Steam, or Hot Water heating coils can be used for regenerator air heaters. If this dehumidifier is placed in the main air loop immediately downstream of a direct expansion (DX) cooling coil, then the dehumidifier’s operation can be coordinated with the operation of the companion DX coil and it is also possible to specify that the DX system’s condenser waste heat can be used to help regenerate the desiccant heat exchanger. For the case of condenser waste heat regeneration, an optional exhaust fan can also be modeled by this desiccant dehumidifier compound object to help maintain a set point temperature for air entering the regeneration side of the desiccant heat exchanger.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the optional exhaust air fan is modeled internal to the Dehumidifier:Desiccant:System and a separate fan object should <em>not</em> be added to the input data file (idf) for this fan. On the other hand, a separate fan object <em>is</em> required in the input data file for the regeneration air fan.</p>

<p>Currently the only heat exchanger choice for this object is HeatExchanger:Desiccant: BalancedFlow. So to model a Dehumidifier:Desiccant:System located in an air loop, the input data file should include the following objects:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Dehumidifier:Desiccant:System (in an air loop (AirLoopHVAC) Branch or AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem:EquipmentList for an AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HeatExchanger:Desiccant:BalancedFlow (desiccant heat exchanger child object)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HeatExchanger:Desiccant:BalancedFlow:PerformanceDataType1 (desiccant heat exchanger data object)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ZoneControl:Humidistat, and one of:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SetpointManager:SingleZone:Humidity:Maximum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SetpointManager:MultiZone:Humidity:Maximum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SetpointManager:MultiZone:MaximumHumidity:Average</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(when in an air loop (AirLoopHVAC) Branch), and  SetpointManager:OutdoorAirPretreat (when in an AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem) to place a maximum humidity ratio set point on the sensor node, typically the process air outlet node</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fan:OnOff or Fan:ConstantVolume (regeneration air fan)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coil:Heating:Electric or Coil:Heating:Gas (optional regeneration air heater)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed or Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoStageWithHumidityControlMode (optional companion cooling coil)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If the user wants to model the Dehumidifier:Desiccant:System in an AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem, then the process air path of the dehumidifier should be located in the outdoor air stream and the regeneration air path may be placed in the relief air stream or modeled by the desiccant dehumidifier itself where the first node for the regeneration inlet air stream must be an outdoor air node. If the user wants to model the Dehumidifier:Desiccant:System in an air loop (AirLoopHVAC) Branch, then the process air path of the dehumidifier should be located in the air loop Branch object. For this case, the regeneration air stream is modeled by the desiccant dehumidifier object itself (i.e., not part of an air loop Branch statement) and the first node for the regeneration inlet air stream must be an outdoor air node (ref. Figure 141 or Figure 142).</p>
<p>A description of each input field for this object is provided below:</p>
<h4 id="field-name_72">Field: Name</h4>
<p>A unique, user-assigned name for a particular Dehumidifier:Desiccant:System. Any reference to this dehumidifier by another object will use this name.</p>
<h4 id="field-availability-schedule-name_24">Field: Availability Schedule Name</h4>
<p>The name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the dehumidifier can operate during a given time period. A schedule value greater than 0 (usually 1 is used) indicates that the dehumidifier can operate. A value less than or equal to 0 (usually 0 is used) denotes that the dehumidifier will not operate (i.e., no heat exchange will take place and the regeneration air fan does not operate). If the field is blank, the schedule has a value of 1 for all time periods. For the case where companion cooling coil regeneration air heating has been specified, the desiccant dehumidifier’s exhaust fan serves as the condenser air fan for the cooling coil system so this availability schedule will not disable exhaust fan operation.</p>
<h4 id="field-desiccant-heat-exchanger-object-type">Field: Desiccant Heat Exchanger Object Type</h4>
<p>This alpha field contains the type of desiccant heat exchanger used with this dehumidifier. Currently, the only valid choice is HeatExchanger:Desiccant:BalancedFlow.</p>
<h4 id="field-desiccant-heat-exchanger-name">Field: Desiccant Heat Exchanger Name</h4>
<p>This alpha field contains the name of the desiccant heat exchanger used with this dehumidifier.</p>
<h4 id="field-sensor-node-name">Field: Sensor Node Name</h4>
<p>This alpha field specifies the name of the air loop node used to control desiccant heat exchanger operation. A set point manager must be used to place a maximum humidity ratio set point on this node (e.g., SetpointManager:SingleZone:Humidity:Maximum or SetpointManager:OutdoorAirPretreat).</p>
<h4 id="field-regeneration-air-fan-object-type">Field: Regeneration Air Fan Object Type</h4>
<p>This alpha field contains the type of regeneration air fan used. Available fan types are Fan:OnOff and Fan:ConstantVolume.</p>
<h4 id="field-regeneration-air-fan-name">Field: Regeneration Air Fan Name</h4>
<p>This alpha field contains the name of the regeneration air fan used with this dehumidifier.</p>
<h4 id="field-regeneration-air-fan-placement">Field: Regeneration Air Fan Placement</h4>
<p>This alpha field specifies the fan configuration used in the desiccant dehumidifier. Valid choices are ‘BlowThrough’ and ‘DrawThrough’, with a default of ‘DrawThrough’ if this field is left blank.</p>
<h4 id="field-regeneration-air-heater-object-type">Field: Regeneration Air Heater Object Type</h4>
<p>This alpha field contains the type of heating coil used to heat the regeneration air stream. This field may be left blank when no regeneration air heater is required. The hot water and steam heating coils require specifying plant loop, branches, and connector objects to support the heating coils, and are placed on the demand side of the plantloop. The hot water flow modulation through the regeneration air heating coil does not require additional controller or Controller:WaterCoil object. The parent object (Dehumidifier:Desiccant:System) itself provides the "controller" function of modulating water flow. Valid choices are:</p>
<p>Coil:Heating:Electric</p>
<p>Coil:Heating:Gas</p>
<p>Coil:Heating:Water</p>
<p>Coil:Heating:Steam</p>
<h4 id="field-regeneration-air-heater-name">Field: Regeneration Air Heater Name</h4>
<p>This alpha field contains the name of the heating coil used to heat the regeneration air stream. This field may be left blank when no regeneration air heater is required.</p>
<h4 id="field-regeneration-inlet-air-setpoint-temperature">Field: Regeneration Inlet Air Setpoint Temperature</h4>
<p>This optional numeric field specifies the regeneration air inlet temperature setpoint in Celsius. The regeneration air heater and/or the companion coil regeneration air heating will be controlled to this temperature to the extent possible. This field may be left blank when no regeneration air heater is required or when control of the exhaust fan used with the companion coil regeneration air heating option is not required.</p>
<h4 id="field-companion-cooling-coil-object-type">Field: Companion Cooling Coil Object Type</h4>
<p>This optional alpha field contains the type of companion cooling coil used with this desiccant dehumidifier. The only valid choices are Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed and Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoStageWithHumidityControlMode.</p>
<h4 id="field-companion-cooling-coil-name">Field: Companion Cooling Coil Name</h4>
<p>This optional alpha field contains the name of the companion cooling coil used with this desiccant dehumidifier. This field may be left blank when no companion cooling coil is being modeled.</p>
<h4 id="field-companion-cooling-coil-upstream-of-dehumidifier-process-inlet">Field: Companion Cooling Coil Upstream of Dehumidifier Process Inlet</h4>
<p>This choice field specifies if the companion cooling coil is located immediately upstream of the dehumidifier’s process inlet. Valid choices are Yes and No. If Yes is selected, then the outlet air node for the companion cooling coil must be the same as the dehumidifier’s process air inlet node (i.e., the process air inlet node name for the desiccant heat exchanger specified for this desiccant dehumidifier). For this case, the companion cooling coil and the desiccant dehumidifier are assumed to operate “in tandem”; that is, if the simulation determines that the companion cooling coil is unable to meet the humidity set point specified on the sensor node based on its own operation, then the desiccant dehumidifier operates at the same time and for the same duration as the cooling coil to provide improved dehumidification. If No is selected, then the dehumidifier will control to the humidity set point specified on the sensor node to the extent possible. The default value is No if this field is left blank.</p>
<h4 id="field-companion-coil-regeneration-air-heating">Field: Companion Coil Regeneration Air Heating</h4>
<p>This choice field determines if the companion cooling coil’s condenser waste heat is used to heat the regeneration inlet air. Valid choices are Yes and No. The default value is No if this field is left blank.</p>
<h4 id="field-exhaust-fan-maximum-flow-rate">Field: Exhaust Fan Maximum Flow Rate</h4>
<p>This optional numeric field contains the maximum fan volumetric flow rate for the exhaust fan in cubic meters per second. As noted previously, this exhaust fan is modeled internally by the Dehumidifier:Desiccant:System object and a separate fan object should NOT be specified in the input data file for this fan. This field is used only when a companion cooling coil is specified and the ‘Companion Coil Regeneration Air Heating’ field is set to ‘Yes’. This field must be used in conjunction with the ‘Exhaust Fan Maximum Power’ and the ‘Exhaust Fan Power Curve Name’ input fields. The model assumes that the exhaust fan will operate as needed to maintain the ‘Regeneration Inlet Air Setpoint Temperature’, up to the maximum flow rate specified in this input field. If the desiccant dehumidifier is OFF for a simulation timestep but its companion cooling coil is operating and is specified to provide regeneration air heating, then the exhaust fan operates at this maximum air flow rate (i.e., this fan serves as the condenser fan for the companion cooling coil system when regeneration air heating is specified, so the inputs to the companion cooling coil object should not include the condenser fan energy since the condenser fan energy is modeled by the Dehumidifier:Desiccant:System object).</p>
<h4 id="field-exhaust-fan-maximum-power">Field: Exhaust Fan Maximum Power</h4>
<p>This optional numeric field contains the maximum power for the exhaust fan in Watts (i.e., at the Exhaust Fan Maximum Flow Rate). This field is used only when a companion cooling coil is used and the ‘Companion Coil Regeneration Air Heating’ field is set to ‘Yes’. This field must be used in conjunction with the ‘Exhaust Fan Maximum Flow Rate’ and the ‘Exhaust Fan Power Curve Name’ input fields.</p>
<h4 id="field-exhaust-fan-power-curve-name">Field: Exhaust Fan Power Curve Name</h4>
<p>This optional alpha field contains the name of the exhaust fan power modifier curve. This field is used only when a companion cooling coil is used and the ‘Companion Coil Regeneration Air Heating’ field is set to ‘Yes’. This field must be used in conjunction with the ‘Exhaust Fan Maximum Flow Rate’ and the ‘Exhaust Fan Maximum Power’ input fields. If this field is blank, the exhaust fan operates (when required) at the maximum power specified in the field above. The curve object type for this Exhaust Fan Power Curve Name must be Curve:Cubic or Curve:Quadratic. The curve object (Curve:Cubic or Curve:Quadratic) defines the change in exhaust fan power as a function of the ratio of the actual exhaust air flow rate divided by the maximum flow rate.</p>

<h2 id="group-energy-management-system-ems">Group – Energy Management System (EMS)</h2>
<p>The Energy Management System (EMS) is one of the high-level control methods available in EnergyPlus. An EMS is able to access a wide variety of “sensor” data and use this data to direct various types of control actions. The concept is to emulate, inside EnergyPlus, the types of controls possible with the digital energy management systems used in real buildings.</p>
<p>In the hierarchy of EnergyPlus controls, the EMS module is a high-level, generalized, supervisory control for building systems. The EMS replicates the functionality of many of the existing high-level control objects in EnergyPlus. Similar to the AvailabilityManager objects, the EMS can turn on and off pumps and fans. Similar to the DemandManager objects, the EMS can turn on and off lights and electric equipment, change the set points on zone thermostats, and dispatch on-site generation. Similar to the SetpointManager objects, the EMS can change the set points on system nodes. Similar to the PlantEquipmentOperation objects, the EMS can turn on and off supply-side heating, cooling, and heat rejection equipment, i.e., boilers, chillers, cooling towers, etc. Similar to the ElectricLoadCenter:Distribution, the EMS can turn on and off on-site generation equipment.</p>
<p>A separate document called <em>Application Guide for EMS</em> contains much more information on how to use the EMS. The EMS uses the EnergyPlus Runtime Language (Erl) for custom programming of control routines.</p>
<h3 id="energymanagementsystemsensor">EnergyManagementSystem:Sensor</h3>
<p>The EnergyManagmentSystem:Sensor object is used to declare an Erl variable that is linked to EnergyPlus output variables or meters. EMS sensors are used to get information from elsewhere in the model for use in control calculations.  The separate output files called eplusout.rdd and eplusout.mdd provide a listing of the output variables and meters that can be used as sensors.</p>
<h4 id="field-name_73">Field: Name</h4>
<p>This field contains a unique name for the sensor that becomes the name of a variable for use in Erl programs. No spaces are allowed in the object name. This name will be a global variable in Erl programs and cannot duplicate any other global scope Erl variable.</p>
<h4 id="field-outputvariable-or-outputmeter-index-key-name">Field: Output:Variable or Output:Meter Index Key Name</h4>
<p>The key reference for the specified output variable. For example, if System Node Temperature is the output variable, the unique node name is the key. The <em>Key Name</em> field should be omitted for weather variables and meters because they do not have a key.</p>

<h3 id="energymanagementsystemactuator">EnergyManagementSystem:Actuator</h3>
<p>This object maps an Erl variable to a control actuator elsewhere in EnergyPlus. The EMS then initiates control actions by changing the value of this variable inside an Erl program. The Application Guide for EMS contains much more information on EMS actuators. The eplusout.EDD file can contain a listing of the actuators available for a specific model.</p>
<h4 id="field-name_74">Field: Name</h4>
<p>The field contains a unique name for the actuator that becomes the name of a variable for use in Erl programs. No spaces are allowed in the object name. This name will be a global variable in Erl programs and cannot duplicate any other global scope Erl variable.</p>
<h4 id="field-actuated-component-unique-name">Field: Actuated Component Unique Name</h4>
<p>This field defines a unique name for the specific entity that is to be controlled. The names for each individual component are listed in the EDD output file when Verbose mode is used – see the input object Output:EnergyManagementSystem for more on the EDD file. These will often be user-defined names of input objects or system nodes, but some actuators are automatically setup by the program and will not be completely user-defined.</p>
<h4 id="field-actuated-component-type">Field: Actuated Component Type</h4>
<p>The field defines the type of the entity that is to be controlled by the actuator. The component types available vary with the specifics of individual models. The types of components that can be used as actuators in a specific model are listed in the EDD output file – see the input object Output:EnergyManagementSystem for more on the EDD file. Components can be object types defined elsewhere in the IDD but there are other types of entities such as nodes and system-level actuators that do not directly correspond to IDF objects.</p>
<h4 id="field-actuated-component-control-type">Field: Actuated Component Control Type</h4>
<p>This field defines the type of control to be done on the specific entity being controlled. The control types available are listed in the EDD output. Specific components may have more than one type of control available, such as flow rate or temperature, and this field is used to distinguish between them.</p>

<h3 id="energymanagementsystemprogramcallingmanager">EnergyManagementSystem:ProgramCallingManager</h3>
<p>The EnergyManagementSystem:ProgramCallingManager object is used to specify when individual Erl programs are run. This object manages two temporal aspects of running Erl programs. The first is when they are run relative to the rest of EnergyPlus, and the second is when they are run relative to each other. EMS applications can use multiple EnergyManagementSystem:ProgramCallingManager objects. For example, one manager may execute an initialization program once at the beginning of the run period while additional managers call various sets of programs from different EMS Calling Points.</p>
<p>Control schemes can be organized using a multiple Erl programs and this object this specifies the order in which they are executed. <em>Program Name 1</em> is run first, <em>Program Name 2</em> is run second, etc. The run order can be important if there are interactions or dependencies between two or more programs. Within each program there may be calls to execute subroutine programs but only calling managers are used to execute main-level programs.</p>
<h4 id="field-name_75">Field: Name</h4>
<p>This is a unique name for this particular program manager.</p>
<h4 id="field-energyplus-model-calling-point">Field: EnergyPlus Model Calling Point</h4>
<p>This field describes when the Erl programs managed under this object are called during an EnergyPlus simulation. All of the programs listed are called at this same calling point. There are 15 possible calling points summarized below. For more information see the section on EMS Calling Points in the Application Guide for EMS.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>BeginNewEnvironment. This calling point occurs near the beginning of each environment period. Environment periods include sizing periods such as design days and run periods. This calling point will not be useful for control actions but is useful for initialization of Erl program variables and other one-time set up actions for EMS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AfterNewEnvironmentWarmUpIsComplete. This calling point occurs at the beginning of each environment period but after warm up days are complete. Warm up days are used to condition the transient aspects of the model with the first day before proceeding. This calling point will not be useful for control actions but is useful for re-initializing Erl programs with fresh values after warm up is complete. Programs called from this point might be used to reset counters or summed variables that would change during warmup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BeginTimestepBeforePredictor. This calling point happens near the beginning of each timestep but before predictor executes. “Predictor” refers to the step in EnergyPlus modeling where the zone’s thermal loads are calculated. This calling point is useful for controlling components that affect the thermal loads that the systems will be attempting to meet. Programs called from this point might actuate the building envelope or internal gains based on current weather and the results from the previous timestep.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AfterPredictorBeforeHVACManagers. This calling point happens each timestep just after predictor executes but before the traditional supervisory control models for SetpointManager and AvailabilityManager are called. This calling point is useful for a variety of control actions. However, if there are conflicts, the EMS control actions may be overwritten by the actions of any traditional SetpointManagers or AvailabilityManagers in the model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AfterPredictorAfterHVACManagers. This calling point happens each timestep after predictor executes and after the SetpointManager and AvailabilityManager models are called. This calling point is useful for a variety of control actions. However, if there are conflicts, SetpointManager or AvailabilityManager actions may be overwritten by EMS control actions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>InsideHVACSystemIterationLoop. This calling point happens each HVAC iteration. The HVAC systems solvers iterate to convergence within each timestep and this calling point is inside this iteration loop. This calling point is useful for a variety of control actions. Being inside the interation loop, this calling point has the advantage that input data need not necessarily be lagged from prior timestep results and can, in some cases, improve the accuracy of controls. The disadvantage is that programs may run an excessive number of times slowing down the execution of the program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EndOfZoneTimestepBeforeZoneReporting. This calling point happens each zone timestep just before the output reports are updated for zone-timestep variables and meters. This calling point is useful for custom output variables with “Zone” frequency because they will be in sync with the rest of the zone output variables.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EndOfZoneTimestepAfterZoneReporting. This calling point happens each zone timestep just after the output reports are updated for zone-timestep variables and meters. This calling point is the last one of a timestep and is useful for making control decisions for the next zone timestep using the final meter values for the current zone timestep.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EndOfSystemTimestepBeforeHVACReporting. This calling point happens each system timestep just before the output reports are updated for HVAC-timestep variables and meters. This calling point is useful for custom output variables with “HVAC” frequency because they will be in sync with the rest of the system output variables.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EndOfSystemTimestepAfterHVACReporting. This calling point happens each system timestep just after the output reports are updated for HVAC-timestep variables and meters. This calling point is useful for making control decisions for the next system timestep using the final meter values for the current system timestep.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EndOfZoneSizing. This calling point happens once during each simulation and only if the run is set to do zone sizing. The calling point occurs just after the native zone sizing calculations are completed but before the sizing results are finalized. This calling point is useful for taking the intermediate results of zone sizing calculations and modifying them based on custom calculations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EndOfSystemSizing. This calling pont happens once during each simulation and only if the run is set to do system sizing. The calling point occurs just after the native air system sizing calculations are completed but before the sizing results are finalized. This calling point is useful for taking the intermediate results of zone and system sizing calculations and modifying them based on custom calculations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AfterComponentInputReadIn. This calling point occurs early in the simulation when  HVAC component’s input data has been processed but before any component-level calculations for automatic sizing. This calling point occurs once for each of the types of HVAC components that have EMS actuators for autosize overrides. This calling point is not directly useful for control actions but is useful for overriding the results of sizing at the component level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>UserDefinedComponentModel. This calling point occurs when user-defined HVAC and plant component models are called to be simulated.  This calling point is only used for the programs that model custom components.  This calling point differs from the others in that when it is being used the calls to trigger include a reference to a specific EnergyManagementSystem:ProgramCallingManager and only the one manger is executed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>UnitarySystemSizing.  This calling point occurs when Unitary systems begin their calculations for determining the size values for autosized input fields.  This calling point is used for overriding the autosizing outcomes for unitary systems.  Each unitary system in the simulation will call this point one time.  This calling point is used to override sizing in the following input objects:  AirLoopHVAC:UnitarySystem, AirLoopHVAC:Unitary:Furnace:HeatOnly, AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatOnly, AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatCool,AirLoopHVAC:Unitary:Furnace:HeatCool, AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:AirToAir, and AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:WaterToAir.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="energymanagementsystemprogram">EnergyManagementSystem:Program</h3>
<p>The EnergyManagementSystem:Program object is the central processor of the EMS and the primary container for the <em>EnergyPlus Runtime Language</em>, or Erl. The EnergyManagementSystem:Program objects are run in the order and point during an EnergyPlus simulation that is specified in an EnergyManagementSystem:ProgramCallingManager object. Multiple EnergyManagementSystem:Program objects are allowed and may interact (or interfere) with each other. The <em>Application Guide for EMS</em> provides a comprehensive overview of Erl programming.</p>
<p>The object definition is very simple. There is a name followed by lines of Erl program code.</p>
<h4 id="field-name_76">Field: Name</h4>
<p>This field is the unique name of the Erl program. The name can be used to call the program to run from another program or subroutine. No spaces are allowed in the name.</p>
<h4 id="field-set-program-lines-1-to-n">Field Set:  Program lines 1 to N</h4>
<p>Each remaining field contains a single line of code for the <em>EnergyPlus Runtime Language</em>, or Erl. Erl is a little programming language with its own syntax. The commas separating fields can be thought of as end of line characters. The <em>Application Guide for EMS</em> provides a the details on Erl program code.</p>

<h3 id="energymanagementsystemsubroutine">EnergyManagementSystem:Subroutine</h3>
<p>The EnergyManagementSystem:Subroutine object contains a block of code written in the <em>EnergyPlus Runtime Language</em> that can be run from another Erl program. If the subroutine is never called, it will never run by itself. Subroutines are useful for encapsulating code that is called in multiple places. It is also helpful for organizing and structuring code. When the subroutine finishes running, control is returned to the object that called it. See the <em>Application Guide for EMS</em> for information on writing Erl programs.</p>
<h4 id="field-name_77">Field: Name</h4>
<p>The name uniquely identifying the subroutine. The name can be used to call the subroutine to run from a program or another subroutine or even itself. No spaces are allowed in the name.</p>
<h4 id="field-set-lines-1-to-n">Field set:  Lines 1 to N</h4>
<p>Each remaining field contains a single line of code for the <em>EnergyPlus Runtime Language</em>, or Erl. Erl is a little programming language with its own special syntax. The commas separating fields can be thought of as end of line characters. The <em>Application Guide for EMS</em> contains the details on the rules for Erl program code.</p>

<h3 id="energymanagementsystemglobalvariable">EnergyManagementSystem:GlobalVariable</h3>
<p>The EnergyManagementSystem:GlobalVariable object declares one or more global variables that can be accessed by all Erl programs in the EMS. Erl variables declared by the user as sensor and actuators objects are already global variables. Global scope variables are needed to move date in and out of subroutines because Erl does not support passing arguments within such calls. Global scope variables are also needed to pass an Erl variable result to an output variable. Each field in this object names a new global Erl variable.</p>
<h4 id="field-erl-variable-1n-name">Field: Erl Variable (1..N) Name</h4>
<p>The name becomes the global Erl variable name that can be referenced in the <em>EnergyPlus Runtime Language</em>. No spaces are allowed in the object name. The name must be unique across all global scope variables including those declared as sensor and actuators and the built-in variables.</p>
<p>IDF examples using this object follow:</p>

<h3 id="energymanagementsystemoutputvariable">EnergyManagementSystem:OutputVariable</h3>
<p>The <strong>EnergyManagementSystem:OutputVariable</strong> object creates a custom output variable that is mapped to an EMS variable. These can be declared by an <strong>EnergyManagementSystem:Sensor</strong> object, an <strong>EnergyManagementSystem:Actuator</strong> object, or an <strong>EnergyManagementSystem:GlobalVariable</strong> object, or any local variable in an Erl program. The custom output variable can then be reported to the output file using the standard EnergyPlus output mechanisms such as with the Output:Variable object.</p>
<p>The EnergyManagementSystem:OutputVariable object is a primary way to obtain data from an Erl program and is likely to be essential for developing and debugging programs. This object also provides a powerful mechanism to create custom output variables. See the <em>Application Guide for EMS</em> for more information.</p>
<h4 id="field-name_78">Field: Name</h4>
<p>This field contains the user-defined name for the new output variable.

<h3 id="energymanagementsystemmeteredoutputvariable">EnergyManagementSystem:MeteredOutputVariable,</h3>
<p>The EnergyManagementSystem:MeteredOutputVariable object creates a custom output variable that is mapped to an EMS variable and is also included in the metering system that EnergyPlus has for aggregating results for different resources across the model.  This object is very similar to EnergyManagementSystem:OutputVariable with the main differences being that only “summed” types of data in the Erl variable and the quantity is to be added to a meter.  This allows for custom output variables that also impact the results for the amount of electricity or gas consumed.</p>
<h4 id="field-name_79">Field: Name</h4>
<p>This field contains the user-defined name for the new output variable. This is the name that will appear in the RDD and MTD output files and can be referenced in other input for output such as an Output:Variable object. Units are provided in the Units field.</p>

<h3 id="energymanagementsystemtrendvariable">EnergyManagementSystem:TrendVariable</h3>
<p>The EnergyManagementSystem:TrendVariable object declares a global trend EMS variable that can be accessed by all Erl programs in the EMS. Trend variables store the recent history of the Erl variable they are associated with. The trend data are useful for examining the progression of time series data. The user declares a new trend variable using this object and associates it with another global Erl variable that will be logged. Trend data are pushed into a stack so that the most recent data are always at the beginning of the stack. Once the stack is full, the oldest data are lost from the trend log. Each value in the trend log is for a zone timestep into the past. The first value in the trend is the one from the previous zone time step.</p>
<h4 id="field-name_80">Field: Name</h4>
<p>The object name becomes the global EMS trend variable name that can be referenced in the <em>EnergyPlus Runtime Language</em>. No spaces are allowed in the name. Then name must be unique across all global scope variables including those declared as sensor and actuators and the built-in variables.</p>
<h4 id="field-ems-variable-name_2">Field: EMS Variable Name</h4>
<p>This field contains the EMS variable name that is to be mapped to the trend variable. This must be a global EMS variable defined elsewhere and cannot have spaces.</p>
<h4 id="field-number-of-timesteps-to-be-logged">Field: Number of Timesteps to be Logged</h4>
<p>This field describes how much data are to be held in the trend variable. The trended data are held in an array with one value for each data point going back in time. This field determines how many elements are in that array. If there are six timesteps per hour and this field is set to 144, then the trend will contain data for the most recent 24 hours period.</p>
<p>Examples of this object follow.</p>
<p>EnergyManagementSystem:TrendVariable,</p>

<h3 id="energymanagementsysteminternalvariable">EnergyManagementSystem:InternalVariable</h3>
<p>The EMS also provides a method to obtain static data from elsewhere in the model. Whereas EMS sensors are used for time-varying data, there are also data that describe certain design parameters for the building which may be useful for EMS calculations. A method for accessing internal data is provided as a time saver and means of better generalizing Erl programs for wider applicability. Information needed for this input object is output by EnergyPlus to the eplusout.edd file – see the Output:EnergyManagementSystem input object. The EDD file can list the internal data index keys and types that are available for use with this object. The Application Guide for EMS discusse internal variables in more depth.</p>
<h4 id="field-name_81">Field: Name</h4>
<p>This field contains a unique name for the internal variable that becomes the name of a variable for use in Erl programs. No spaces are allowed in the name. This name will be a global variable in Erl programs and cannot duplicate any other global scope EMS variable.</p>
<h4 id="field-internal-data-index-key-name">Field: Internal Data Index Key Name</h4>
<p>This field contains the unique identifier for the internal variable. This is usually a name defined by the user elsewhere in an IDF input object. For example, for an internal variable for the floor area of a zone, this would be the name of the zone.</p>
<h4 id="field-internal-data-type">Field: Internal Data Type</h4>
<p>This field defines the type of internal data source that is to be mapped to the EMS variable. The types of internal source data that can be used as internal variables are listed in the EIO output file whan an input file has any EMS-related objects.</p>
<p>An example of this object follows.</p>
<p>EnergyManagementSystem:InternalVariable,</p>

<h3 id="energymanagementsystemcurveortableindexvariable">EnergyManagementSystem:CurveOrTableIndexVariable</h3>
<p>The EMS provides a method for reusing curve and table input objects from elsewhere in the model.  Input objects, such as Curve:Cubic, Curve:Biquadratic, or Table:TwoIndependetVariables, are used by various component models to describe performance relationships in a generic way.  By using an EnergyManagementSystem:CurveOrTableIndexVariable input object, these curves and tables can be used in your own Erl programs.  This object sets up an Erl variable that contains an index that points to specific curve or table.  This index variable is then used as the first argument in a call to the built-in function called @CurveValue so that the correct curve or table is evaluated.</p>
<h4 id="field-name_82">Field: Name</h4>
<p>This field contains a unique name for the index variable that becomes the name of a variable for use in Erl programs. No spaces are allowed in the name. This name will be a global variable in Erl programs and cannot duplicate any other global scope EMS variable.  The variable will be filled by the EMS system to have a value that “points” to the curve or table object named in the following field.</p>
<h4 id="field-curve-or-table-object-name">Field: Curve or Table Object Name</h4>
<p>This field contains the unique name of a Curve:* or Table:* object defined elsewhere in the input file.  The Erl variable in the previous field will be filled with the index for the curve or table named here.  The value of this index tracks the order that Curve: and Table: input objects are listed in the input file.</p>
<p>An example IDF object is:</p>
<p>EnergyManagementSystem:CurveOrTableIndexVariable,</p>
<p>Curve_Quadratic_Ptr,       !- Name</p>
<p>HPACCOOLPLFFPLR_curve;     !- Curve or Table Object Name</p>
<h3 id="energymanagementsystemconstructionindexvariable">EnergyManagementSystem:ConstructionIndexVariable</h3>
<p>The EMS provides actuators for overriding the type of construction used by a surface.  The EnergyManagementSystem:ConstructionIndexVariable input object is used to setup an Erl variable that contains an index that points to specific Construction.  This index variable is then used with a special actuator called “Surface” with the control type “Construction State.  See the Application Guide for EMS for more information on how to use this index variable and the associated actuator.</p>
<h4 id="field-name_83">Field: Name</h4>
<p>This field contains a unique name for the index variable that becomes the name of a variable for use in Erl programs. No spaces are allowed in the name. This name will be a global variable in Erl programs and cannot duplicate any other global scope EMS variable.  The variable will be filled by the EMS system to have a value that “points” to the Construction object named in the following field.</p>

<h2 id="group-externalinterface">Group – ExternalInterface</h2>
<p>The ExternalInterface allows coupling EnergyPlus to the Building Controls Virtual Test Bed (BCVTB). It supports the import of Functional Mock-up Units (FMUs) for co-simulation as well as the export of EnergyPlus as a FMU for co-simulation. BCVTB is a software environment that allows expert users to couple different simulation programs for distributed simulation or for a real-time simulation that is connected to a building control system. For example, the BCVTB allows simulation of the building envelope and HVAC system in EnergyPlus and the control logic in MATLAB/Simulink, while exchanging data between the two programs as they simulate. The BCVTB can be downloaded from http://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/bcvtb. A FMU is a component which implements the Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) standard (http://www.modelisar.com).</p>
<h3 id="externalinterface">ExternalInterface</h3>
<p>This object activates the external interface of EnergyPlus. If the object ExternalInterface is present, then the external interface objects listed below will receive their values from the BCVTB interface or from FMUs at each zone time step. If this object is not present, then the values of these objects will be fixed at the value declared in the “initial value” field of the corresponding object, and a warning will be written to the EnergyPlus error file.</p>

<h4 id="field-name_86">Field: Name</h4>
<p>This field contains a unique name for the actuator. No spaces are allowed in the object name. This name will be a global read-only variable in Erl programs and cannot duplicate any other global scope Erl variable.</p>
<h4 id="field-actuated-component-unique-name_1">Field: Actuated Component Unique Name</h4>
<p>This field defines a unique name for the specific entity that is to be controlled. The names for each individual component are listed in the EDD output file when Verbose mode is used – see the input object <strong>Output:EnergyManagementSystem</strong> for more on the EDD file. These will often be user-defined names of input objects or system nodes, but some actuators are automatically setup by the program and will not be completely user-defined.</p>
<h4 id="field-actuated-component-type_1">Field: Actuated Component Type</h4>
<p>The field defines the type of the entity that is to be controlled by the actuator. The component types available vary with the specifics of individual models. The types of components that can be used as actuators in a specific model are listed in the EDD output file – see the input object <strong>Output:EnergyManagementSystem</strong> for more on the EDD file. Components can be object types defined elsewhere in the IDD but there are other types of entities such as nodes and system-level actuators that do not directly correspond to IDF objects.</p>
<h4 id="field-actuated-component-control-type_1">Field: Actuated Component Control Type</h4>
<p>This field defines the type of control to be done on the specific entity being controlled. The control types available are listed in the EDD output.

<h4 id="field-initial-value_1">Field: Initial Value</h4>
<p>This field contains the initial value. If a value is specified, then this value is used during the warm-up period and the system sizing. If no value is specified, then the actuated component will only be updated once the time stepping starts, i.e., after the warm-up and the system-sizing. This allows, for example, to schedule a setpoint with a Schedule:Compact during warm-up and system-sizing, and then overwrite the value of this schedule during each zone time step based on a feedback control loop that is implemented in the BCVTB.</p>

This is helpful because not every conceivable type of HVAC equipment or system configuration has already had models implemented in EnergyPlus.  HVAC or plant components, or even entire system configurations, might be so new, unusual, or proprietary that no model has yet been implemented in the software.  An analyst faced with project that needs to model such a device or system could do so using one or more of the user defined components described in this section.</p>
<p>Some building energy performance rating systems allow analysts to option of using “exceptional calculation methods” when a simulation program cannot perform the function required to be modeled. These user defined component models are intended to provide a means for including such exceptional calculations within the context of a full EnergyPlus model.  This allows using EnergyPlus for everything it can model and extending it yourself to include a new type of HVAC or Plant component.</p>
<p>These objects are advanced.  Making good use of them requires the user to have a detailed understanding of EnergyPlus HVAC and Plant models as well as the Energy Management System (EMS).  The EnergyPlus Runtime Language (Erl) is used to program the component model.  The Application Guide for EMS provides more discussion of how to use the objects in this group – see the chapter called User-Defined Component Models.</p>

<h2 id="group-system-availability-managers">Group – System  Availability Managers</h2>
<p>System Availability Managers are one of the high-level control constructs in EnergyPlus. A System Availability Manager is able to access data from any of the HVAC system nodes and use this data to to make a decision on whether an entire AirLoopHVAC or PlantLoop should be on or off. Some of the zone component objects  (e.g. unit heater, unit ventilator, packaged terminal air conditioner, packaged terminal heat pump, zone water source heat pump,window air conditioner, zone terminal unit (variable refrigerant flow), energy recovery ventilator, outdoor air unit, fan coil unit, and ventilated slab) can also individually use availability managers to make a decision regarding whether their fan should be on or off.</p>
<p>System Availability Managers are executed at the start of each HVAC timestep. They reside outside the HVAC system iteration loops. Thus, the System Availability Managers are executed once per HVAC timestep, and they use previous timestep information (except for zone load) to calculate their set points.</p>
<p>Some of the managers monitor the temperature at an air or plant node to determine whether the system should be on or off. If the system is to be controlled on the outdoor dry-bulb temperature, an OutdoorAir:NodeList object can be used to define a node which will have the current outdoor air conditions.</p>
<p>The output from each System Availability Manager is an availability status flag. This flag can have the values <em>NoAction</em>, <em>ForceOff</em>, <em>CycleOn</em>, or <em>CycleOnZoneFansOnly</em>. The availability status flags for the System Availability Managers referenced by an air or plant loop are used to set the availability status flag for each loop. For the air loops and zone components, <em>ForceOff</em> takes precedence: if any of the loop’s (or zone component’s) availability managers are showing status <em>ForceOff</em>, the loop (or zone component fan) status will be <em>ForceOff</em>. Next in precedence is <em>CycleOnZoneFansOnly</em> (only for air loop), followed by <em>CycleOn,</em> and <em>NoAction</em>. For the plant loops, there is no precedence among the System Availability Manager status flag values. Instead, the first availability manager giving a status flag value other than <em>NoAction</em> sets the status for the loop. The System Availability Managers are executed in AvailabilityManagerAssignmentList order.</p>
<p>The actual action of turning on or off a loop is taken by the loop prime movers: fans for AirLoopHVACs and zone components, and pumps for plant loops. For instance when a fan is deciding whether it is on or off, it checks its on/off schedule and whether the loop availability status flag is <em>CycleOn</em> or <em>ForceOff</em>. If the schedule is on and the status flag is <em>ForceOff</em>, the fan will be off. If the fan schedule says off and the status flag is <em>CycleOn</em>, the fan will be on. Thus the availability managers overrule the fan on/off schedule. The availability managers, air loops, and plant loops all have output variables which may be used to verify the action of the loop.</p>
<p>Availability managers for AirLoopHVAC systems also control the availability of zone exhaust fans (Ref. Fan:ZoneExhaust) and terminal unit fans (Ref. AirTerminal:SingleDuct:SeriesPIU: Reheat, AirTerminal:SingleDuct:ParallelPIU:Reheat, and AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV: Reheat:VariableSpeedFan) in the zones served by the AirLoopHVAC system.</p>
<h3 id="availabilitymanagerscheduled">AvailabilityManager:Scheduled</h3>
<p>The simplest System Availability Manager is when the availability is determined by an on/off schedule.The syntax for implementing such an availability manager is shown below. The identifying name refers back to the name recorded in the AvailabilityManagerAssignmentList statement described in the <strong>Group – Air Distribution</strong> section. The schedule must be the name of a schedule defined elsewhere in the input.</p>
<h4 id="field-name_93">Field: Name</h4>
<p>The unique, user-assigned name of an instance of a scheduled availability manager. Other objects that use this scheduled availability manager will reference it by this name.</p>
<h4 id="field-schedule-name">Field: Schedule Name</h4>
<p>The name of a schedule defined elsewhere in the input. Schedule values greater than zero (usually 1 is used) indicate that the system is on. Schedule values less than or equal to zero (usually 0 is used) denote that the system is off. This schedule overides the central fan schedule for determining whether the fan is on.</p>

<h3 id="availabilitymanagerscheduledon">AvailabilityManager:ScheduledOn</h3>
<p>The Schedule On Availability Manager is used when equipment must be turned on during a given time period. This availability manager will not turn the equipment off, a separate availability manager must be used to disable the equipment as necessary. The scheduled on availability is determined by an on schedule. Schedule values other than 0 set a <em>CycleOn</em> availability status. Schedule values equal to 0 set a <em>NoAction</em> availability status. The syntax for implementing such an availability manager is shown below. The identifying name refers back to the name recorded in the AvailabilityManagerAssignmentList statement described in the <strong>Group – Air Distribution</strong> section. The schedule must be the name of a schedule defined elsewhere in the input.</p>
<h4 id="field-name_94">Field: Name</h4>
<p>The unique, user-assigned name of an instance of a scheduled on availability manager. Other objects that use this scheduled on availability manager will reference it by this name.</p>
<h4 id="field-schedule-name_1">Field: Schedule Name</h4>
<p>The name of a schedule defined elsewhere in the input. Schedule values greater than zero (usually 1 is used) indicate that the system is on. Schedule values less than or equal to zero (usually 0 is used) denote that <em>NoAction</em> is desired. This schedule overides the central fan schedule for determining whether the fan is on.</p>

<h3 id="availabilitymanagerscheduledoff">AvailabilityManager:ScheduledOff</h3>
<p>The Schedule Off Availability Manager is used when equipment must be turned off during a given time period. This availability manager will not turn the equipment on, a separate availability manager must be used to enable the equipment as necessary. The scheduled off availability is determined by an off schedule. Schedule values equal to 0 set a <em>ForceOff</em> availability status. Schedule values other than 0 (usually a 1 is used) set a <em>NoAction</em> availability status. The syntax for mplementing such an availability manager is shown below. The identifying name refers back to the name recorded in the AvailabilityManagerAssignmentList statement described in the <strong>Group – Air Distribution</strong> section. The schedule must be the name of a schedule defined elsewhere in the input.</p>

<p>HVAC,Average,Availability Manager Scheduled Off Control Status</p>
<h4 id="availability-manager-scheduled-off-control-status">Availability Manager Scheduled Off Control Status []</h4>
<p>A value of 0 indicates the manager is signaling <em>NoAction</em>. A value of 1 means the manager is signaling <em>ForceOff</em>.</p>
<h3 id="availabilitymanagernightcycle">AvailabilityManager:NightCycle</h3>
<p>This manager is used for cycling on an air system when one or more zones become too hot or too cold. The usual situation is that the central air handler is turned off at night. However if the building gets too cold there might be condensation on the walls and other damage. Thus the control system is usually programmed to turn the system on if 1 control thermostat or any thermostat shows a zone temperature of less than a night time set point. Similarly there might be a concern about a building getting too hot. Again the control system is programmed to turn the air handler back on if one or any zone temperature exceeds a night time cooling set point.</p>
<p>This object gives the user considerable flexibility in determining how the night time on/off decision will be made. The manager can look at the temperature in 1 zone or it can sample all the zones connected to the air handler. The user can specify a temperature tolerance and a run time for the system once it switches on. There is also an applicability schedule – the user can schedule whether or not this availability manager itself is being applied.</p>
<p><strong><em>Field: Name</em></strong></p>
<p>A unique, user-assigned name for an instance of a night cycle availability manager. Other objects that use this availability manager will reference it by this name.</p>
<p><strong><em>Field: Applicability Schedule Name</em></strong></p>
<p>The name of a schedule defined elsewhere in the input file. This schedule determines whether or not for a given time period this availability manager is to be applied. Schedule values greater than zero (usually 1 is used) indicate the availability manager is to be applied. Schedule values less than or equal to zero (usually 0 is used) denote that the availability manager is not used for this time period.</p>
<p><strong><em>Field: Fan Schedule Name</em></strong></p>
<p>The name of the central fan on/off schedule for the air system that this availability manager will affect.</p>
<p><strong><em>Field: Control Type</em></strong></p>
<p>The possible inputs are <em>StayOff</em>, <em>CycleOnAny</em>, <em>CycleOnControlZone</em>, <em>CycleOnAnyZoneFansOnly</em>. <em>StayOff</em> means the availability manager will have no effect – air handler on/off will be determined by the fan schedule. <em>CycleOnAny</em> means that if any zone served by a system whose AvailabilityManagerAssignmentList references this system availability manager has an air temperature outside the cooling or heating set points the central fan will turn on even though the fan schedule indicates the fan is off. <em>CycleOnControlZone</em> means the same thing except the availability manager looks at the temperature in only one zone. <em>CycleOnAnyZoneFansOnly</em> is the same as <em>CycleOnAny</em> except that only the zone fans are cycled on and the central air handler fan is left off. The default is <em>StayOff</em>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Field: Thermostat Tolerance</em></strong></p>
<p>The Thermostat Tolerance defines the amount by which the zone temperature must fall outside the current zone heating and cooling setpoints for the Night Cycle manager to turn the system on. The zone temperature must exceed the cooling set point or fall below the heating set point by 1/2 the Thermostat Tolerance in order for the availability manager to signal that the system should turn on. The Thermostat Tolerance is specified in degrees Celsius. The default is 1 degree C.</p>
<p><strong><em>Field: Cycling Run Time</em></strong></p>
<p>The time in seconds for which the system will run after it has cycled on. The default is 3600 seconds (1 hour).</p>
<p><strong><em>Field: Control Zone Name</em></strong></p>
<p>For the option <em>CycleOnControlZone</em> this is the name of the control zone.</p>

<h4 id="availability-manager-night-cycle-control-status">Availability Manager Night Cycle Control Status</h4>
<p>A value of 0 indicates the manager is signaling <em>NoAction</em>. A value of 2 means the manager is signaling <em>CycleOn</em>. A value of 3 says that the manager is signaling <em>CycleOnZoneFansOnly</em>.</p>
<h3 id="availabilitymanagerdifferentialthermostat">AvailabilityManager:DifferentialThermostat</h3>
<p>The differential thermostat compares the temperatures at two different system nodes. If the temperature difference (DT) is above the <em>Temperature Difference On Limit</em>, the system is turned on. If the DT is below the <em>Temperature Difference Off Limit</em>, the system is turned off. Between the <em>On Limit</em> and <em>Off Limit</em> the system is either on or off depending on the previous state of the thermostat. Unlike other availability managers, the differential thermostat is always either "On" or "Off"; it does not use the "No Action" state. Therefore, the differential thermostat must be the last manager in the AvailabilityManagerAssignmentList. Any availability managers after the differential thermostat manager will never be simulated.</p>
<p>One application of the differential thermostat is to ensure a useful heat gain for solar heating systems, i.e. the system is only turned on when there is a significant temperature difference between the solar collector outlet node and the storage tank outlet node.</p>

<h3 id="availabilitymanagernightventilation">AvailabilityManager:NightVentilation</h3>
<p>This manager allows the user to implement a strategy for precooling a building at night using outdoor air. This strategy can consist of running the system fans with the outdoor air dampers open when outdoor conditions are favorable for a precooling strategy. The zone terminal unit air dampers may also be held at their fully open position to minimize fan energy consumption while precooling. Fan energy consumption is the critical parameter in deciding whether a precooling strategy will save energy.</p>
<p>The inputs for the night ventilation manager consist of an applicability schedule name (determining when the manager is active), a fan schedule name (for the fan(s) that the manager can switch on), a ventilation temperature schedule name (one zone must be above this temperature for night venting to be active), a ventilation temperature difference (indoor – outdoor temperature difference for night venting), a low limit temperature (no conditioned zone may fall below this temperature during night venting),  a night venting flow fraction (fraction of the design flow rate at which the fans run during night venting), and the zone name of a control zone.</p>
<p>The night ventilation manager is used in conjunction with another object: FanPerformance:NightVentilation. The performance of the fan during night venting may be very different than during normal operation (a different fan might even be used). The FanPerformance:NightVentilation object allows the user to specify alternate fan performance parameters for use during night ventilation.</p>

<p>A value of 0 indicates the manager is signaling NoAction. A value of 2 means the manager is signaling CycleOn.</p>
<h3 id="availabilitymanagerhybridventilation">AvailabilityManager:HybridVentilation</h3>
<p>This availability manager is executed at the start of each HVAC system timestep, before EnergyPlus calculates airflows defined in the objects ZoneInfiltration:*, ZoneVentilation:*, ZoneMixing, and ZoneCrossMixing, and before the AirflowNetwork model calculates multizone airflows. It serves two purposes: 1) prevents simultaneous natural ventilation and HVAC system operation, and 2) allows users to examine various ventilation strategies to maximize natural ventilation in order to reduce heating/cooling loads. The natural ventilation objects controlled by this availability manager have two groups: simple airflow group and AirflowNetwork group. The simple airflow group consists of the ZoneVentilation;* and ZoneMixing objects. The AirflowNetwork group consists of AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Component:DetailedOpening and AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Component:SimpleOpening objects used in the AirflowNetwork model. These two groups are not allowed to work simultaneously (see restrictions in the Airflow Network model section). Basically, this object overrides the controls for these opening objects or ZoneVentilation:* and ZoneMixing objects, closing the “openings” or shutting off ventilation/mixing airflows under certain conditions and allowing the HVAC system (AirLoopHVAC) to operate. If the availability manager determines that conditions are favorable for natural ventilation, then the HVAC system (AirLoopHVAC) is disabled and the “opening” objects or ventilation/mixing objects are able to operate based on the controls specified for those objects.</p>
<p>Each AirLoopHVAC can have a corresponding hybrid ventilation availability manager. Each hybrid ventilation manager can control natural ventilation in the zones served by the AirLoopHVAC. The hybrid ventilation availability manager is triggered by zone air conditions for the controlled zone specified in an object input field. If there is no air loop, hybrid ventilation manager can still be applied to controlled zone specified in the object. To apply hybrid ventilation manager to the controlled zone not served by any air loop, the HVAC air loop name input field must be left blank. Currently, zone component objects such as unit heater, unit ventilator, packaged terminal air conditioner, packaged terminal heat pump, zone water source heat pump, window air conditioner, variable refrigerant flow, energy recovery ventilator, outdoor air unit, fan coil unit, and ventilated slab can individually use hybrid ventilation managers to make a decision regarding whether their fan should be on or off. Also, hybrid ventilation managers can be applied to zones served by ideal load zone components to turn them off when natural ventilation is active. Currently, hybrid ventilation manager is restricted to one per zone. It can either be applied through the air loop or directly to the zone. If hybrid ventilation manager is applied to an air loop and one of the zones served by the air loop also has hybrid ventilation manager, then zone hybrid ventilation manager is disabled. Presently, this availability manager must be used either with the ZoneVentilation:* and ZoneMixing objects or with the AirflowNetwork model.</p>
<p>The inputs for this availability manager consist of the name for the air loop (AirLoopHVAC) being controlled, the controlled zone name to determine which zone air conditions are used to determine system availability, a ventilation control mode schedule, maximum wind speed and rain indicator to determine whether natural ventilation is allowed or not, a low limit and high limit for dry-bulb temperature, enthalpy and dewpoint temperature to determine the hybrid ventilation control, and a minimum outdoor air ventilation schedule. The last control allows user to use a wind speed modifier to adjust openness when the AirflowNetwork opening objects are selected. The other inputs include how to control simple airflow objects and AirflowNetwork opening objects.</p>
<p>The hybrid ventilation availability manager works independently of all other system availability manager objects, so this manager is not a valid system availability manager type in the AvailabilityManagerAssignmentList object.</p>
<h4 id="field-name_102">Field: Name</h4>
<p>A unique, user-assigned name for an instance of a hybrid ventilation availability manager. Other objects that use this availability manager will reference it by this name.</p>
<h4 id="field-hvac-air-loop-name">Field: HVAC Air Loop Name</h4>
<p>The name of the air loop (AirLoopHVAC object) to be controlled by this system availability manager. If this field is left blank, hybrid ventilation manager will be applied to the controlled zone specified in the field below.</p>

<p>The name of a controlled zone served by the air loop defined in the previous field. The air conditions in this zone are used to determine if natural ventilation should be provided.</p>
<h4 id="field-ventilation-control-mode-schedule-name">Field: Ventilation Control Mode Schedule Name</h4>
<p>The name of a schedule defined elsewhere in the input file. This schedule determines whether or not for a given time the hybrid ventilation control mode is to be applied. Schedule values equal to zero indicate no ventilation control, resulting in natural ventilation and HVAC system operation being performed based on their own controls. Schedule values equal to one denote temperature control for either cooling or heating, which is determined internally based on thermostat set point and temperature control type. The temperature control is restricted between the minimum and maximum outdoor temperatures provided in two additional input fields (below). Schedule values equal to two denote enthalpy control, which is restricted between minimum and maximum outdoor enthalpy values given in two additional input fields (below). Schedule values equal to three denote dewpoint control for either dehumidification or humidification. Schedule values equal to four represent outdoor ventilation air control. The outdoor ventilation air control works with AirflowNetwork opening objects only, and is not allowed to work with ZoneVentilation:* and ZoneMixing objects.</p>
<p>The detailed control logic is given in the EnergyPlus Engineering Reference.</p>
<h4 id="field-use-weather-file-rain-indicators">Field: Use Weather File Rain Indicators</h4>
<p>This logical alpha field indicates whether or not the rain indicator is used to shut off natural ventilation or not. The valid choices for Rain Indicator are Yes and No, with the default being Yes. This can help simulate conditions where one would normally close windows to avoid rain penetration in a space. Any possible rain getting into a space will not be counted as a zone load.</p>
<h4 id="field-maximum-wind-speed">Field: Maximum Wind Speed</h4>
<p>This is the wind speed (m/s) above which hybrid ventilation is shut off.  This can help simulate conditions where one would normally close windows to avoid wind problems in a space (papers blowing around, etc).</p>
<h4 id="field-minimum-outdoor-temperature">Field: Minimum Outdoor Temperature</h4>
<p>This is the outdoor temperature (in Celsius) below which hybrid ventilation is shut off when the ventilation control mode = 1 (Temperature). This lower temperature limit is intended to avoid overcooling a space, which could result in a heating load.</p>
<h4 id="field-maximum-outdoor-temperature">Field: Maximum Outdoor Temperature</h4>
<p>This is the outdoor temperature (in Celsius) above which hybrid ventilation is shut off when the ventilation control mode = 1 (Temperature). This upper temperature limit is intended to avoid overheating a space, which could result in a cooling load.</p>
<h4 id="field-minimum-outdoor-enthalpy">Field: Minimum Outdoor Enthalpy</h4>
<p>This is the outdoor enthalpy (in J/kg) below which hybrid ventilation is shut off when the ventilation control mode = 2 (Enthalpy).</p>
<h4 id="field-maximum-outdoor-enthalpy">Field: Maximum Outdoor Enthalpy</h4>
<p>This is the outdoor enthalpy (in J/kg) above which hybrid ventilation is shut off when the ventilation control mode = 2 (Enthalpy).</p>
<h4 id="field-minimum-outdoor-dewpoint">Field: Minimum Outdoor Dewpoint</h4>
<p>This is the outdoor dewpoint (in Celsius) below which hybrid ventilation is shut off when the ventilation control mode = 3 (Dewpoint). This lower dewpoint temperature limit is intended to avoid dehumidifying a space.</p>
<h4 id="field-maximum-outdoor-dewpoint">Field: Maximum Outdoor Dewpoint</h4>
<p>This is the outdoor dewpoint temperature (in Celsius) above which hybrid ventilation is shut off when the ventilation control mode = 3 (Dewpoint). This upper dewpoint temperature limit is intended to avoid humidifying a space.</p>
<h4 id="field-minimum-outdoor-ventilation-air-schedule-name">Field: Minimum Outdoor Ventilation Air Schedule Name</h4>
<p>The name of a schedule defined elsewhere in the input file. This field applies only if Ventilation Control Mode = 4 (Outdoor Ventilation Air Control). This schedule determines the minimum outdoor ventilation air for a given time in the units of air change per hour (ACH). The program calculates the natural (outdoor) ventilation in the controlled zone first and compares the amount of outdoor air introduced by opening windows or doors and other small openings to this minimum value. If the amount of outdoor air from natural ventilation is less than the minimum value, the natural ventilation is shut off (i.e., the window or door openings are closed) and the HVAC system may operate if needed. Otherwise, the natural ventilation is on and the HVAC system is shut off. The amount of outdoor ventilation air entering the controlled zone is determined as air from outdoors and not from other adjacent zones. Therefore, this option is only applied to a zone having a window or door exposed to outdoors.</p>
<h4 id="field-opening-factor-function-of-wind-speed-curve-name">Field: Opening Factor Function of Wind Speed Curve Name</h4>
<p>The name of a linear or quadratic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of opening factor as a function of outdoor wind speed. The output of this curve is multiplied by the opening factor of opening objects to give the final openness. This field only works with the AirflowNetwork opening objects.</p>
<h4 id="field-airflownetwork-control-type-schedule-name">Field: AirflowNetwork Control Type Schedule Name</h4>
<p>The name of a schedule defined elsewhere in the input file. This field works with the AirflowNetwork opening objects only. This schedule determines for a given simulation timestep how the opening objects respond to the hybrid ventilation control when the hybrid ventilation control allows the objects to operate.</p>
<p>Schedule values equal to zero indicate individual ventilation control based on the control requirements specified for each individual AirflowNetwork opening object. Schedule values equal to one denote ”group” control. The opening objects exposed to outdoors in the controlled zone served by the primary air loop (Ref. Field “HVAC Air Loop Name”) will be considered as a master to provide group control.</p>
<h4 id="field-simple-airflow-control-type-schedule-name">Field: Simple Airflow Control Type Schedule Name</h4>
<p>The name of a schedule defined elsewhere in the input file. This field works with ZoneVentilation:* and ZoneMixing objects only. This schedule determines for a given simulation timestep how the ZoneVentilation:* and ZoneMixing objects respond to the hybrid ventilation control when the hybrid ventilation control allows the objects to operate.</p>
<p>Schedule values equal to zero indicate the individual ventilation control based on the control requirements from their own objects. Schedule values equal to one denote group control. The ZoneVentilation:* and ZoneMixing objects in the zones served by the primary air loop defined in a previous input field (Ref. Field “HVAC Air Loop Name”) are controlled by a single object, whose name is provided in the following input field.</p>
<h4 id="field-zoneventilation-object-name">Field: ZoneVentilation Object Name</h4>
<p>The name of a ZoneVentilation:* object whose zone name is the controlled zone name defined in a previous input field for this availability manager object (Ref. Field “Controlled Zone Name”). The controls defined for this specific ZoneVentilation:* object to enable ventilation air will be applied to other ZoneVentilation:* and ZoneMixing objects served by the air loop controlled by this availability manager, regardless of the controls defined for the other ZoneVentilation:* and ZoneMixing objects. In other words, when ventilation is enabled by this specific ZoneVentilation:* object, the other ZoneVentilation:* and ZoneMixing objects in the zones served by the primary air loop are also enabled.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> A <strong>ZoneInfiltration:*</strong> object indicates any one of <strong>ZoneInfiltration:DesignFlowRate</strong>, <strong>ZoneInfiltration:EffectiveLeakageArea</strong>,and <strong>ZoneInfiltration:FlowCoefficient</strong> objects.A object of<strong>ZoneVentilation:*</strong> indicates any one of <strong>ZoneVentilation:DesignFlowRate</strong> and <strong>ZoneVentilation:WindandStackOpenArea</strong> objects<strong>.</strong></p>

A zero value indicates no hybrid ventilation control, corresponding to zero value defined in the previous output variable. A value of one indicates that natural ventilation is allowed. A value of two denotes that the natural ventilation is not allowed, so all window/door openings are closed.</p>
<h3 id="availabilitymanageroptimumstart">AvailabilityManager:OptimumStart</h3>
<p>When night time temperature setback and/or setup are employed, the optimum start availability manager is used to start the HVAC system prior to occupancy to ensure that the space is comfortable when people appear in the building.</p>
<h4 id="field-name_103">Field: Name</h4>
<p>A unique, user-defined name for an instance of this availability manager.</p>
<h4 id="field-applicability-schedule-name_2">Field: Applicability Schedule Name</h4>
<p>This schedule decides whether for a given time period this availability manager is to be applied. Schedule value of 1 specifies the availability manager is to be applied. Schedule value of 0 indicates that the availability manager is not used for this time period</p>
<h4 id="field-fan-schedule-name_1">Field: Fan Schedule Name</h4>
<p>The name of the central fan schedule for the air system that this availability manager will govern.</p>
<h4 id="field-control-type_1">Field: Control Type</h4>
<p>The possible inputs are StayOff, MaximumofZoneList, and ControlZone. StayOff means the availability manager will have no effect – air handler on/off will be determined by the fan schedule. ControlZone means a specific zone mentioned in the field will govern the start time. The default is ControlZone. MaximumofZoneList means that from all zones mentioned in the zone list field in this availability manager maximum value of start time will be used to start the fan.</p>
<h4 id="field-control-zone-name_1">Field: Control Zone Name</h4>
<p>For Control type ControlZone the name of zone is added here. Start time for this zone will be used for the air loop.</p>
<h4 id="field-zone-list-name">Field: Zone List Name</h4>

<h4 id="field-maximum-value-for-optimum-start-time">Field: Maximum Value for Optimum Start Time</h4>
<p>To limit too early start of the system maximum value for the start time can be entered here. Optional input, defaults to 6 hours. This is the maximum number of hours that a system can start before occupancy.</p>
<h4 id="field-control-algorithm">Field: Control Algorithm</h4>
<p>The four possible inputs are <strong>ConstantTemperatureGradient, AdaptiveTemperatureGradient, AdaptiveASHRAE,</strong> and <strong>ConstantStartTime</strong>. In ConstantTemperatureGradient algorithm the temperature gradient entered by the user will be constant throughout the simulation. The response to heating and cooling operation can be non-linear thus two separate fields for temperature gradients are used.  AdaptiveTemperatureGradient algorithm will modify the temperature gradients based on the arithmetic average of the actual temperature gradients calculated for the specified number of previous days. For this algorithm user should enter two initial start values. AdaptiveASHRAE algorithm implements equations suggested in ASHRAE Handbook – HVAC Applications (2007). This algorithm will calculate the coefficients of the equation within the code and users need not provide temperature response related inputs. ConstantStartTime method calculates the start time based on specified number of hours before occupancy for each day. <strong>The AdaptiveASHRAE algorithm has not been implemented yet.</strong></p>
<h4 id="field-constant-temperature-gradient-during-cooling">Field: Constant Temperature Gradient during Cooling</h4>

Start time, the number of hours before occupancy occurs for a system, for heating and cooling operation is entered here. Irrespective of thermal response, the heating or cooling operation starts before the occupancy at this fixed time. This start time value remains constant throughout the simulation.</p>
<h4 id="field-number-of-previous-days">Field: Number of Previous Days</h4>

<p>The unit is in hour.</p>
<h2 id="group-setpoint-managers">Group – Setpoint Managers</h2>
<p>Setpoint Managers are one of the high-level control constructs in EnergyPlus. A Setpoint Manager is able to access data from any of the HVAC system nodes and use this data to calculate a setpoint (usually a temperature setpoint) for one or more other HVAC system nodes. Setpoints are then used by Controllers or Plant or Condenser Loops as a goal for their control actions.</p>
<p>Setpoint Managers are executed at the start of each HVAC timestep, and they reside outside the HVAC system iteration loops. Thus, the Setpoint Managers are executed once per HVAC timestep, and they use previous timestep information (except for zone load) to calculate their setpoints.</p>
<p>The following situations require the use of a Setpoint Manager:</p>
<p>1)    any use of Controller:WaterCoil; either in “Temperature” control only or 2 Setpoint Managers for the " TemperatureAndHumidityRatio " control variable option.</p>
<p>2)    use of Controller:OutdoorAir with <em>Economizer Control Type</em> set to anything but <em>NoEconomizer</em>;</p>
<p>3)    use of Coil:Heating:Gas or Coil: Heating: Electric with the field <em>Temperature Setpoint Node Name</em> set to a node name;</p>
<p>4)    any use of CoilSystem:Cooling:DX;</p>
<p>5)    any use of Humidifier:Steam:Electric.</p>
<p>6)    Any use of PlantLoop or CondenserLoop which doesn't use an environment reference such as AIR or GROUND as a set point</p>
<p>Setpoint managers will place a calculated or scheduled setpoint value on the setpoint node and overwrite any previous value. This value may represent one of several control types (e.g., Temperature, HumidityRatio, MassFlowRate, etc.). No two setpoint managers should use the same setpoint node for like control types.</p>
<p>For the case when two setpoint managers place a setpoint on the same setpoint node (e.g., a temperature setpoint placed on the same node by two different setpoint managers), the setpoint value on the node is calculated by the last setpoint manager simulated. Within a specific type of setpoint manager (e.g., Scheduled), the setpoint managers are simulated in the order found in the input data file (idf) when viewed using a text editor. It is also possible for two different types of setpoint managers to place setpoints of like control variable on the same node. In this case, the order of simulation for the type of setpoint manager determines which setpoint manager is the last to write a setpoint value to the node. This conflict in setpoint node data is most likely to cause inaccurate simulation results. For this reason, a conflicting setpoint node name warning message is issued so that the conflict can be resolved.  Duplicate setpoint node names found within a specific node list will not typically cause problems with the simulation (the same value is written twice to the same node). In this case a duplicate setpoint node name warning is issued, however, this could be an error in the spelling of the node name and should be corrected.</p>

<h3 id="setpointmanagerscheduled">SetpointManager:Scheduled</h3>
<p>The simplest Setpoint Manager simply uses a schedule to determine one or more setpoints. No node data is used as input. The input consists of the Setpoint Manager name, the control variable, the schedule name, and the name of a node list. The node list contains the name of those nodes at which the setpoint is to be applied. Of course, a node list name can always be simply the name of a single node.</p>
<p>Note that although this object provides a very general method of setting the values of many different control variables on nodes, the component models and system solvers may or may not be able to use them. Therefore, it is important to understand that simply setting a control variable using this object will not necessarily always produce the desired behavior.</p>
<h4 id="field-name_104">Field: Name</h4>
<p>A unique, user-assigned name for an instance of a scheduled setpoint manager. Anywhere in the input that this setpoint manager is used, it is referred to by this name.</p>
<h4 id="field-control-variable">Field: Control Variable</h4>
<p>The type of variable that will be controlled. There are several choices for this type of set point manager. The most common control variable is Temperature but other major choices include: HumidityRatio and MassFlowRate. The versatility of control variables available here (probably) exceeds what is actually available in the component and systems models. However, a large number of possible control variables are made available here for maximum flexibility and because some (but not all) component models will be able to use them. The complete list of key words and the units required in the associated schedules follow.</p>

<p>This setpoint manager places a high and low schedule value on one or more nodes.

<h3 id="setpointmanagermixedair">SetpointManager:MixedAir</h3>
<p>The Mixed Air Setpoint Manager is meant to be used in conjunction with a Controller:OutdoorAir object. This setpoint manager is used to establish a temperature setpoint at the mixed air node. The Controller:OutdoorAir then operates the outdoor air damper to attempt to meet this setpoint.</p>
<p>In EnergyPlus the relief and outdoor air dampers, the economizer, and any outdoor air conditioning equipment form a separate subsystem of an air loop system (ref. AirLoopHVAC). The outdoor air controller operates within the subsystem. Consequently the mixed air temperature setpoint must take into account any downstream system fan heat if it is to meet a desired system supply air leaving temperature. The Mixed Air Setpoint Manager accomplishes this by referencing a supply air setpoint set by another setpoint manager (most likely at the AirLoopHVAC outlet node). The supply fan inlet and outlet nodes are also inputs to the Mixed Air Setpoint Manager. From this information the Mixed Air Setpoint Manager calculates the supply fan air temperature rise, subtracts it from the reference setpoint temperature, and sets the result as the mixed air node setpoint temperature.</p>
<p>Of course any type of setpoint manager can be used to establish a temperature setpoint at the mixed air node. But the Mixed Air Setpoint Manager is likely to be the most useful.</p>

<p>The OutdoorAir Pretreat Setpoint Manager is meant to be used in conjunction with an OutdoorAir:Mixer object. The Outdoor air Pretreat Setpoint Manager is used to establish a temperature or humidity ratio setpoint in the outdoor air stream flowing into the "Outdoor Air Stream Node" of an OutdoorAir:Mixer object. This setpoint manager determines the required setpoint in the outdoor air stream to produce the reference setpoint in the mixed air stream after mixing with return air. For example, if the temperature setpoint at the mixed air node is 15°C, the return air temperature is 20°C, and the outdoor air flow fraction is 0.5, the Outdoor Air Pretreat setpoint would be set to 10°C.</p>
<p>Of course any type of setpoint manager can be used to establish setpoints in the outdoor air stream, but this setpoint manager is likely to be the most useful for systems which precondition outdoor air with equipment such as a DX cooling coil or desiccant dehumidifier.</p>

<h3 id="setpointmanagerwarmest">SetpointManager:Warmest</h3>
<p>The Warmest Setpoint Manager resets the cooling supply air temperature of a central forced air HVAC system according to the cooling demand of the warmest zone. For each zone in the system at each system timestep, the manager calculates a supply air temperature that will meet the zone cooling load at the maximum zone supply air flow rate. The lowest of the possible supply air temperatures becomes the new supply air temperature setpoint, subject to minimum and maximum supply air temperature constraints. The resulting temperature setpoint is the highest supply air temperature that will meet the cooling requirements of all the zones. When compared to a fixed cooling supply air temperature setpoint, this strategy minimizes zone reheat coil energy (or overcooling) and central chiller energy consumption (if the chilled water temperature is also reset) at the cost of possible increased fan energy.</p>

<p>The Coldest Setpoint Manager is used in dual duct systems to reset the setpoint temperature of the air in the heating supply duct. Usually it is used in conjunction with a SetpointManager:Warmest resetting the temperature of the air in the cooling supply duct. For each zone in the system at each system timestep, the manager calculates a supply air temperature that will meet the zone heating load at the maximum zone supply air flow rate. The highest of the possible supply air temperatures becomes the new supply air temperature setpoint, subject to minimum and maximum supply air temperature constraints. The resulting temperature setpoint is the lowest supply air temperature that will meet the heating requirements of all the zones. When compared to a fixed heating supply air temperature setpoint, this strategy minimizes central boiler energy consumption (if the hot water temperature is also reset or there are variable speed pumps) at the cost of possible increased fan energy (if there is variable volume control in the air system).</p>

<h3 id="setpointmanagerreturnairbypassflow">SetpointManager:ReturnAirBypassFlow</h3>
<p>This manager is user in conjunction with a return air bypass configuration. This type of air system is basically a standard single duct system with the addition of a bypass duct that bypasses return air around the main system components – in particular, the central cooling coil. This allows the central cooling coil to sufficiently dehumidify the mixed air; the bypassed air is then added to the supply air stream to bring the supply air temperature up to the desired temperature set point. This scheme is very useful in situations where an higher than normal supply air temperature is used – for instance, in underfloor air distribution systems.</p>
<p>This manager relies on the program to figure out the system configuration and to extract the needed data from the system nodes. All the user needs to input is the name of the air system and a schedule giving the desired supply air temperature setpoint. No node names are required. The manager will establish a bypass air flow rate that upon mixing with the non-bypassed air will yield the temperature given in the schedule.</p>

<h3 id="setpointmanagerwarmesttemperatureflow">SetpointManager:WarmestTemperatureFlow</h3>
<p>The Warmest Temperature Flow Setpoint Manager resets the cooling supply air temperature of a central forced air HVAC system according to the cooling demand of the warmest zone. The user can select one of two strategies: <em>TemperatureFirst</em> or <em>FlowFirst</em>.</p>
<p>For <em>TemperatureFirst</em> the manager tries to find the highest setpoint temperature that will satisfy all the zone cooling loads at minimum supply air flow rate. If this setpoint temperature is less than the minimum, the setpoint temperature is set to the minimum, and the supply air flow rate is increased to meet the loads.</p>
<p>For <em>FlowFirst</em> the manager tries to find the lowest supply air flow rate that will satisfy all the zone cooling loads at the maximum setpoint temperature. If this flow is greater than the maximum, the flow is set to the maximum and the setpoint temperature is reduced to satisfy the cooling loads.</p>
<p>When compared to a fixed cooling supply air temperature setpoint, the <em>TemperatureFirst</em> strategy minimizes fan energy at the cost of possible increased zone reheat coil energy (or overcooling) and central chiller energy consumption, whereas the <em>FlowFirst</em> strategy minimizes zone reheat coil energy (or overcooling) and central chiller energy consumption at the cost of possible increased fan energy.</p>

The calculated humidity ratio is then used as the minimum humidity ratio setpoint for the designated setpoint node(s). A humidification component (e.g., Humidifier:Steam:Electric) placed upstream of the setpoint node can then use the minimum humidity ratio setpoint to control humidification rate.

<p>This setpoint manager allows for controlling the maximum humidity level is multiple zones served by a central forced air HVAC system (air loop). This setpoint manager, used in conjunction with one or more ZoneControl:Humidistat objects, detects the air humidity level in multiple controlled zones served by the HVAC air loop and uses air/moisture mass balances to calculate an average supply air humidity ratio needed to maintain the zone relative humidity levels near their respective dehumidifying setpoints. The calculated humidity ratio is then used as the maximum humidity ratio setpoint for the designated setpoint node(s). A dehumidification component (e.g., desiccant dehumidifiers) placed upstream of the setpoint node can then use the maximum humidity ratio setpoint to control its moisture removal rate. The use of this object requires that a “ZoneControl:Humidistat” object be specified with a dehumidifying relative humidity schedule for one or more controlled zones served by the HVAC air loop.</p>

<p>This setpoint manager allows for controlling the minimum humidity level in multiple zones served by a central forced air HVAC system (air loop). This setpoint manager, used in conjunction with one or more ZoneControl:Humidistat objects, detects the air humidity level in multiple controlled zones served by the HVAC air loop and uses air/moisture mass balances to calculate a supply air minimum humidity ratio based on  a zone with the critical  humidification requirement (i.e., a zone with the highest humidity ratio setpoint) to maintain the zone relative humidity levels near their respective humidifying setpoints. The calculated humidity ratio is then used as the minimum humidity ratio setpoint for the designated setpoint node(s). A humidification component (e.g., Humidifier:Steam:Electric) placed upstream of the setpoint node can then use the minimum humidity ratio setpoint to control humidification rate. The use of this object requires that a “ZoneControl:Humidistat” object be specified with a humidifying relative humidity schedule for one or more controlled zones served by the HVAC air loop.  If “ZoneControl:Humidistat” object is defined for only one of the zones served by the air loop then the SetpointManager:MultiZone:Humidity:Minimum perform as SepointManager:SingleZone:Humidity:Minimum.</p>

Further, when the leaving condenser water temperature and condenser water flow are constant, the entering condenser temperature can be used as a proxy for lift. Because most condenser water systems are designed for constant flow, entering condenser temperature is the most common metric for lift, and that is what meant here.

Further, when the leaving condenser water temperature and condenser water flow are constant, the entering condenser temperature can be used as a proxy for lift. Because most condenser water systems are designed for constant flow, entering condenser temperature is the most common metric for lift, and that is what meant here. If the “optimized” condenser entering water setpoint falls below leaving evaporator water temperature plus minimum lift, then the condenser entering water setpoint is reset to equal this field value plus leaving evaporator water temperature. This determines the minimum boundary of condenser entering water setpoint. The unit for this field is deg C TD. Default is 11.1 deg C (20 deg F).</p>

<p>The singe-zone, one-stage cooling setpoint manager allows a component to be controlled based on thermostatic control using the object ZoneControl:Thermostat:StagedDualSetpoint.  This setpoint manager differs from other parts of EnergyPlus that control based on predicted loads to setpoint.  This setpoint manager allows modeling on/off cycling of DX coils using CoilSystem:Cooling:DX in continuous fan air handlers.  This setpoint manger detects if the zone is calling for a cooling stage and applies one setpoint value if cooling is called for and another setpoint value if cooling is not called for.</p>
<p>This method of control is much more like real world thermostatic control but it requires short zone timesteps.  Models using this type of control should use 60 timesteps per hour and will run much slower because of that.</p>

<h3 id="setpointmanagersinglezoneonestageheating">SetpointManager:SingleZoneOneStageHeating</h3>
<p>The singe-zone, one-stage heating setpoint manager allows a component to be controlled based on thermostatic control using the object ZoneControl:Thermostat:StagedDualSetpoint.  This setpoint manager differs from other parts of EnergyPlus that control based on predicted loads to setpoint.  This setpoint manager allows modeling on/off cycling of heating coils in continuous fan air handlers.  This setpoint manger detects if the zone is calling for a heating stage and applies one setpoint value if heating is called for and another setpoint value if heating is not called for.</p>
<p>This method of control is much more like real world thermostatic control but it requires short zone timesteps.  Models using this type of control should use 60 timesteps per hour and will run much slower because of that.</p>

<h2 id="group-controllers">Group – Controllers</h2>
<h3 id="controls-air-loop-and-zone-equipment">Controls (Air Loop and Zone Equipment)</h3>
<p>A controller mimics the function of an actual physical controller in a somewhat rudimentary way. It can sense one node variable, compare it with its setpoint, and determine the desired value for another node variable. It should be noted that a controller cannot span a loop manager boundary (but a Setpoint Manager can). Thus, in an air loop (AirLoopHVAC), the sensed node and the controlled device must be in the air loop simulation. This means that a single zone system cannot be modeled with a simple controller sensing zone temperature and controlling coil water flow. Instead this must be modeled as a Setpoint Manager sensing a zone temperature and resetting the supply air temperature setpoint each timestep. This is artificial but should simplify the control modeling task. It should also be noted that there are various types of controllers and that each controller might hook into loops in a slightly different way. As a result, each controller type is described separately below.</p>
<h3 id="controllerwatercoil">Controller:WaterCoil</h3>
<p>This controller is really a solution inverter. For a water coil the simulation cannot be inverted where the mass flow rate of the water through the coil can be solved directly given an air temperature. Thus, this “controller” will numerically step through all of the water flow possibilities by an interval-halving technique until the mass flow rate is determined to meet the specified outlet air temperature within a specified user tolerance.</p>
<p>As the reader probably noted when reading the descriptions of the coil syntax shown earlier in this section, there were no controls attached directly to a particular component. This is because the input can be simplified somewhat by entering node names to be controlled. This avoids having to search through multiple lists of component types for the sake of simply controlling components. The Controller:WaterCoil shown below is a way of controlling variables at one node based on conditions at another node. After the identifying name for the controller, the user must define which control variable the controller is managing. These options include Temperature, Humidity Ratio, TemperatureAndHumidityRatio), or Flow.</p>
<p>The next parameter in the input syntax is the Action of the control, which determines how the controlled variable (e.g., mass flow rate through a water coil) is changed based on the control signal. The following input parameter is the actuator variable, which is currently limited to mass flow through a water coil.</p>
<p>The next two parameters in the input syntax are node names corresponding to the node that is being sensed and the actuated node which controls the water mass flow through the coil. For example, in the case of a cooling coil the control variable might be the outlet air temperature of the coil while the actuated variable might be the water flow rate through the coil. These two parameters are followed by the controller convergence tolerance. Finally, the last two input parameters represent the maximum and minimum values allowed for the actuated variable at the actuated node.</p>
<h4 id="field-name_131">Field: Name</h4>
<p>This is the unique name of the controller.</p>
<h4 id="field-control-variable_19">Field: Control Variable</h4>
<p>This was setup to be generic but to date has only been used for temperature control, or temperature and humidity ratio control, of a water coil in the air loop simulation. The keyword Temperature is used for air temperature control and is normally specified for the coil’s outlet air node. The keyword TemperatureAndHumidityRatio is used for controlling both air temperature and high humidity levels, and is normally specified for a cooling coil’s outlet air node. The keyword HumidityRatio is used for humidity control and would normally be specified for a dehumidifier outlet node. These two keywords require a ZoneControl:Humidistat object and a maximum humidity setpoint manager object (“SetPointManager:SingleZone:Humidity:Maximum”, “SetPointManager:MultiZone:MaximumHumidity:Average” or “SetPointManager:MultiZone:Humidity:Maximum”). If the coil is located in the outdoor air stream, it may also be necessary to use SetpointManager:OutdoorAirPretreat.</p>
<h4 id="field-action">Field: Action</h4>
<p>The next input refers to the “action” of the control. This can be best described by an example. In a coil where water mass flow rate is to be controlled, a coil will increase the mass flow rate through the coil when more heating or cooling is requested. In a heating coil, this increases the value of heat transfer from the water to the air stream. As a result, this is considered a “Normal” action controller. In a cooling coil, an increase in water mass flow rate through the coil decreases the value of heat transfer from the water to the air stream (absolute value increases, but since cooling is traditionally described as a negative number, an increase in absolute value results in a decrease in the actual heat transfer value). Thus, the cooling coil controller has “Reverse” action since an increase in flow rate results in a decrease in heat transfer.</p>
<h4 id="field-actuator-variable">Field: Actuator Variable</h4>
<p>This was again meant to be more generic but currently has only been used to control the water mass flow rate of a heating or cooling coil. This actuator variable must be set to the keyword Flow to control the water mass flow rate.</p>
<h4 id="field-sensor-node-name_5">Field: Sensor Node Name</h4>
<p>Name of the node where the temperature, humidity ratio or flow is sensed.</p>
<h4 id="field-actuator-node-name">Field: Actuator Node Name</h4>
<p>Name of the actuated node that controls the water mass flow rate through the coil.</p>
<h4 id="field-controller-convergence-tolerance">Field: Controller Convergence Tolerance</h4>
<p>The coil is controlled by knowing the outlet temperature and/or humidity ratio specified by the setpoint managers, and setting the outlet conditions from the coil to meet these setpoints. The hot and chilled water coils use complex models that cannot be inverted directly. Therefore, to determine the correct mass flow rate for the hot or cold water the models are inverted numerically using an iterative procedure. The iterative solution uses an interval-halving routine and needs a termination criteria that is set with the Controller Convergence Tolerance parameter. The convergence tolerance is the maximum difference between the actual temperature at the setpoint node and the setpoint temperature. This control offset is set to a small temperature difference, such as 0.01 to denote 1/100 degree C. The default is 0.1 degree C.</p>
<h4 id="field-maximum-actuated-flow">Field: Maximum Actuated Flow</h4>
<p>This is the maximum water flow (m<sup>3</sup>/sec) through the coil. Set to the maximum design water flow for the coil.</p>
<h4 id="field-minimum-actuated-flow">Field: Minimum Actuated Flow</h4>
<p>Set to the minimum design water flow (m<sup>3</sup>/sec) for the water coil, normally a shut off valve that is set to zero.</p>
<p>An example of this object in an IDF, along with appropriate setpoint managers, is shown below:</p>

<h3 id="controlleroutdoorair">Controller:OutdoorAir</h3>
<p>A mixed air box has its own controller type called Controller:OutdoorAir. The purpose of the outdoor air controller is to provide outdoor air for ventilation and also provide free cooling (through additional outdoor air and/or bypassing an air-to-air heat exchanger) whenever possible. The outdoor air controller includes a number of user-selectable limit controls. If any of the selected limits are exceeded, the outdoor airflow rate is set to the minimum.</p>
<p>If all the limits are satisfied, the outdoor air controller does the following for continuous air flow systems: if the outdoor air temperature is greater than or equal to the mixed air temperature setpoint, the outdoor air flow rate is set to the maximum; if the outdoor air temperature is less than the mixed air temperature setpoint, the outdoor air controller will modulate the outdoor air flow so that the mixed air temperature will match the mixed air setpoint temperature.</p>
<p>A time-of-day schedule may also be used to simulate an increase in outdoor air flow rate for “push-button” type economizer applications. When the schedule permits (i.e., schedule values are greater than 0), the outdoor air flow rate is increased to the user-specified maximum outdoor air flow rate.</p>
<p>The outdoor air controller can also account for changes in the outdoor air flow rate during times when indoor humidity levels are high. A zone humidistat must be used with this control option. During high indoor humidity, the outdoor air flow rate is modified in response to a high indoor humidity condition. If high humidity control is based on the outdoor air humidity ratio and the outdoor humidity ratio is greater than the indoor humidity ratio, high humidity control is terminated. When the economizer is used in conjunction with the high humidity control option, high humidity control has priority and controls the change in air flow rates. The Night Ventilation Availability Manager has priority over high humidity control and will use the controller’s maximum outdoor air flow rate when this Availability Manager cycles the fan on (Ref. System Availability Managers – AvailabilityManager:NightVentilation)</p>
<p>The mixed air box connections are defined separately in the <strong>OutdoorAir:Mixer</strong> object.</p>
<p>Although the mixer will commonly be connected directly to the outdoor air, other components may be placed on the outdoor air path upstream of the mixer. When this is the case, any modulation will be determined by the conditions at the inlet node of the mixer rather than the outdoor air. This means that the controller will account for any heat recovery or other preheating/precooling components that may modify the condition of outdoor air before it reaches the mixer.</p>
<p>If all the limits are satisfied, the outdoor air controller does the following for cycling fan systems: the outdoor air flow rate is set to the maximum when the fan cycles on. If the limits are not satisfied, the outdoor air flow rate is at the minimum when the fan cycles on.</p>
<h4 id="field-name_132">Field: Name</h4>
<p>The unique user-assigned name for an instance of an outdoor air controller. Any other object referencing this outdoor air controller will use this name.</p>
<h4 id="field-relief-air-outlet-node-name">Field: Relief Air Outlet Node Name</h4>
<p>The name of the relief air node of the outdoor air mixer associated with this outdoor air controller.</p>
<h4 id="field-return-air-node-name">Field: Return Air Node Name</h4>
<p>The name of the return air node of the outdoor air mixer associated with this outdoor air controller.</p>
<h4 id="field-mixed-air-node-name">Field: Mixed Air Node Name</h4>
<p>Name of the node where the mixed air setpoint is set. The outdoor air controller senses the temperature at this node and attempts to control that temperature to the node setpoint.</p>
<h4 id="field-actuator-node-name_1">Field: Actuator Node Name</h4>
<p>The name of the node that is associated with the outdoor air damper. This should be the outermost air node on the outdoor air path connected to the outdoor air stream for the mixer associated with this outdoor air controller.</p>
<h4 id="field-minimum-outdoor-air-flow-rate">Field: Minimum Outdoor Air Flow Rate</h4>
<p>Input for this field is the minimum outdoor air flow rate for the system in cubic meters per second.</p>
<h4 id="field-maximum-outdoor-air-flow-rate">Field: Maximum Outdoor Air Flow Rate</h4>
<p>Input for this field is the maximum outdoor air flow rate for the system in cubic meters per second.</p>
<h4 id="field-economizer-control-type">Field: Economizer Control Type</h4>
<p>The options for this field are</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>FixedDryBulb</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DifferentialDryBulb</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FixedEnthalpy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DifferentialEnthalpy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ElectronicEnthalpy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FixedDewPointAndDryBulb</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DifferentialDryBulbAndEnthalpy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NoEconomizer</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Choosing <strong>NoEconomizer</strong> means the economizer will not operate and the outdoor airflow rate will be at the minimum for the entire simulation.</p>
<p>Choosing <strong>FixedDryBulb</strong> means the economizer will set the outdoor airflow rate at minimum if the outdoor air temperature is higher than a specified dry-bulb temperature limit.</p>
<p>Choosing <strong>DifferentialDryBulb</strong> will trigger the outdoor airflow to minimum when the dry-bulb temperature of outdoor air is higher than the dry-bulb temperature of the return air.</p>
<p><strong>FixedEnthalpy</strong> checks the upper limit of the enthalpy given as a field input against the enthalpy content of outdoor air and will set the outdoor airflow rate to minimum if the latter is greater than the former.</p>
<p><strong>DifferentialEnthalpy</strong> does the same thing but compares the return air enthalpy with the enthalpy of outdoor air. When the enthalpy of outdoor air is greater than the enthalpy of the return air, the outdoor air flow rate is set to minimum.</p>
<p>Choosing <strong>ElectronicEnthalpy</strong> enables the simulation to calculate the humidity ratio limit of outdoor air based on the dry-bulb temperature of outdoor air and a quadratic/cubic curve, and compare it to the actual outdoor air humidity ratio. If the actual outdoor humidity ratio is greater than the calculated humidity ratio limit, then the outdoor airflow rate is set to minimum.</p>
<p>Choosing <strong>FixedDewPointAndDryBulb</strong> compares both the outdoor dewpoint temperature and the outdoor dry-bulb temperature to their specified high limit values. If either outdoor temperature exceeds the high limit value, the outdoor airflow rate is set to minimum.</p>
<p>Another option <strong>DifferentialDryBulbAndEnthalpy</strong> enables the control strategy to be based on both the DifferentialDryBulb and DifferentialEnthalpy economizer control strategies.</p>
<p>In addition to all economizer control types listed above, each control type checks for user-entered values for the upper limit of dry-bulb temperature, enthalpy limit, humidity ratio limit and dewpoint limit. The outdoor air flow rate is set to minimum if any of these entered limits are exceeded.</p>
<p>The default for this field is <strong>NoEconomizer</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="field-economizer-control-action-type">Field: Economizer Control Action Type</h4>
<p>There are two choices for this Field: <strong>MinimumFlowWithBypass</strong> and <strong>ModulateFlow</strong>, with the default being <strong>ModulateFlow</strong> if this input field is left blank.</p>
<p><strong>ModulateFlow</strong> means the outdoor air flow rate will be increased to meet the mixed air setpoint temperature, subject to the limits imposed via other inputs for this object (e.g., Economizer Maximum Limit Dry-Bulb Temperature, Maximum Outdoor Air Flow Rate, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>MinimumFlowWithBypass</strong> is used exclusively in conjunction with air-to-air heat exchanger:objects (Ref. HeatExchanger:*) for providing free cooling operation in the absence of a conventional air-side economizer (i.e., when outdoor air flow rate is not increased during economizer mode). The MinimumFlowWithBypass choice forces the outdoor air flow rate to always remain at the minimum. However, when high humidity control is used, the outdoor air flow rate is set to the product of the maximum outdoor air flow rate multiplied by the high humidity outdoor air flow ratio. The heat exchanger uses the limit checking in the outdoor air controller to decide whether or not to bypass the outdoor air around the heat exchanger – or turn off the wheel motor in the case of a rotary heat exchanger. Heat exchange is also suspended when high humidity control is active.</p>
<p>The <strong>ModulateFlow</strong> option can also be used with the HeatExchanger:AirToAir:FlatPlate or HeatExchanger:AirToAir:SensibleAndLatent objects.</p>
<h4 id="field-economizer-maximum-limit-dry-bulb-temperature">Field: Economizer Maximum Limit Dry-Bulb Temperature</h4>
<p>Input for this field is the outdoor air temperature high limit (ºC) for economizer operation. If the outdoor air temperature is above this limit, the outdoor airflow rate will be set to the minimum. This field is required if Economizer Control Type ‘FixedDryBulb’ or ‘FixedDewPointAndDryBulb’ has been specified.</p>
<p>No input (blank) in this field means that there is no outdoor air temperature high limit control. This limit applies to the conditions at the Actuator Node regardless of whether or not there are any other components in the outdoor air path upstream of the mixer.</p>
<h4 id="field-economizer-maximum-limit-enthalpy">Field: Economizer Maximum Limit Enthalpy</h4>
<p>Input for this field is the outdoor air enthalpy limit (in J/kg) for economizer operation. If the outdoor air enthalpy is above this value, the outdoor airflow rate will be set to the minimum. This field is required if Economizer Control Type ‘FixedEnthalpy’ has been specified.</p>
<p>No input (blank) in this field means that there is no outdoor air enthalpy limit control. This limit applies to the conditions at the Actuator Node regardless of whether or not there are any other components in the outdoor air path upstream of the mixer.</p>
<h4 id="field-economizer-maximum-limit-dewpoint-temperature">Field: Economizer Maximum Limit Dewpoint Temperature</h4>
<p>Input for this field is the outdoor air dewpoint limit (ºC) for economizer operation. If the outdoor air dewpoint temperature is above this value, the outdoor airflow rate will be set to the minimum. This field is required if the Economizer Control Type ‘’FixedDewPointAndDryBulb’ has been specified.</p>
<p>No input (blank) in this field means that there is no outdoor air dewpoint limit control. This limit applies to the conditions at the Actuator Node regardless of whether or not there are any other components in the outdoor air path upstream of the mixer.</p>
<h4 id="field-electronic-enthalpy-limit-curve-name">Field: Electronic Enthalpy Limit Curve Name</h4>
<p>Input for this field is the name of a quadratic or cubic curve which provides the maximum outdoor air humidity ratio (function of outdoor air dry-bulb temperature) for economizer operation. If the outdoor air humidity ratio is greater than the curve’s maximum humidity ratio (evaluated at the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature), the outdoor air flow rate will be set to the minimum. This limit applies to the conditions at the Actuator Node regardless of whether or not there are any other components in the outdoor air path upstream of the mixer. No input (blank) in this field means that there is no electronic enthalpy limit control.</p>
<h4 id="field-economizer-minimum-limit-dry-bulb-temperature">Field: Economizer Minimum Limit Dry-Bulb Temperature</h4>
<p>Input for this field is the outdoor air temperature low limit (ºC) for economizer operation. If the outdoor air temperature is below this limit, the outdoor airflow rate will be set to the minimum.</p>
<p>No input (blank) in this field means that there is no outdoor air temperature low limit control. This limit applies to the conditions at the Actuator Node regardless of whether or not there are any other components in the outdoor air path upstream of the mixer.</p>
<h4 id="field-lockout-type">Field: Lockout Type</h4>
<p>Choices for this field are NoLockout, LockoutWithHeating, and LockoutWithCompressor. This field is used for packaged systems with DX coils. LockoutWithHeating means that if the packaged unit is in heating mode, the economizer is locked out – i.e., the economizer dampers are closed and there is minimum outdoor air flow. LockoutWithCompressor means that in addition to locking out the economizer when the unit is in heating mode the economizer is locked out when the DX unit compressor is operating to provide cooling. In other words, the economizer must meet the entire cooling load – it isn’t allowed to operate in conjunction with the DX cooling coil. This option (LockoutWithCompressor) is sometimes called a “nonintegrated” economizer.</p>
<p>The default is NoLockout.</p>
<h4 id="field-minimum-limit-type">Field: Minimum Limit Type</h4>
<p>Choices for this field are FixedMinimum or ProportionalMinimum. FixedMinimum means that the minimum outdoor airflow rate is fixed no matter what the actual system flow rate is. ProportionalMinimum means the minimum outdoor airflow rate varies in proportion to the total system air flow rate. The default is ProportionalMinimum.</p>
<h4 id="field-minimum-outdoor-air-schedule-name">Field: Minimum Outdoor Air Schedule Name</h4>
<p>The name of a schedule which uses decimal values (0.0 – 1.0).  These values are multiplied by the minimum outdoor air flow rate. This schedule is useful for reducing the outdoor air flow rate to zero during unoccupied or start up hours. If this field is not entered, the minimum outdoor air flow rate either remains constant during the simulation period (Minimum Outdoor Air Control Type = FixedMinimum) or varies in proportion to the supply air flow rate (Minimum Outdoor Air Control Type = ProportionalMinimum).</p>
<h4 id="field-minimum-fraction-of-outdoor-air-schedule-name">Field: Minimum Fraction of Outdoor Air Schedule Name</h4>
<p>The name of a schedule which uses decimal values (0.0 – 1.0) These values are multiplied by the total (design) air flow rate.  This is an alternate method for specifying the minimum outdoor air amount.  (The other method is the <strong><em>Minimum Outdoor Air Schedule</em></strong> <em>described above.)  Note:  This field overrides <strong>Minimum Outdoor Air Schedule</strong> and <strong>Minimum Outdoor Air Flowrate.</strong></em></p>
<h4 id="field-maximum-fraction-of-outdoor-air-schedule-name">Field: Maximum Fraction of Outdoor Air Schedule Name</h4>
<p>This is an optional field with the schedule values in decimal fractions (0.0-1.0). This field enables the user to limit the maximum of amount of outdoor air permissible and thus also limits the permissible maximum outdoor air into the system.</p>
<p>If both the above schedules are given values of 1.0, the system works at 100% outdoor air, so in a system if 100% outdoor air is required regardless of any other condition, these fields are helpful.</p>
<h4 id="field-mechanical-ventilation-controller-name">Field: Mechanical Ventilation Controller Name</h4>
<p>This optional field is the name of the mechanical ventilation controller object to be used in conjunction with this outdoor air controller. The Controller:MechanicalVentilation object allows the user to define the minimum outdoor air flow rate based on air flow per unit floor area and air flow per person (occupant) for the zones being served by the air loop that utilizes this controller.</p>
<p>This feature allows the user to perform a first-order evaluation of carbon dioxide(CO<sub>2</sub>)-based demand controlled ventilation (outdoor ventilation varied according to occupancy levels).</p>
<p>If a valid name for a Controller:MechanicalVentilation object is entered in this field, the minimum outdoor air flow rate delivered will be the greater of:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the minimum outdoor air flow rate calculated by the fields Minimum Outdoor Air Flow Rate, Minimum Limit Type, and Minimum Outdoor Air Schedule Name as defined for this outdoor air controller, or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the outdoor air flow rate calculated using the Controller:MechanicalVentilation object named in this input field.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Leaving this input field blank will bypass the Controller:MechanicalVentilation object calculations and the minimum outdoor air flow rate will be based on the other inputs associated with this outdoor air controller object. Actual outdoor air flow rates may be higher than the minimum if free cooling is available and the object inputs are properly selected. Regardless, the maximum outdoor air flow rate is limited by the field Maximum Outdoor Air Flow Rate.</p>
<h4 id="field-time-of-day-economizer-control-schedule-name">Field: Time of Day Economizer Control Schedule Name</h4>
<p>This alpha field is the name of a schedule which controls the outdoor air flow rate based on a time-of-day economizer. Schedule values equal to 0 disable this feature. Schedule values greater than 0 cause the outdoor air flow rate to increase to the maximum. When an economizer is used in conjunction with the high humidity control option, high humidity control has priority.</p>
<h4 id="field-high-humidity-control">Field: High Humidity Control</h4>
<p>This choice field establishes whether or not the outdoor air flow rate is modified in response to high indoor relative humidity. Valid choices are Yes and No. If Yes is selected, the outdoor air flow rate may be modified when the indoor relative humidity is above the humidstat setpoint. If No is selected, this option is disabled and the following three fields are not used.</p>
<h4 id="field-humidistat-control-zone-name">Field: Humidistat Control Zone Name</h4>
<p>This input defines the zone name where the humidistat is located. This is the same name used in the ZoneControl:Humidistat object. This field is required when the input field High Humidity Control is specified as Yes.</p>
<h4 id="field-high-humidity-outdoor-air-flow-ratio">Field: High Humidity Outdoor Air Flow Ratio</h4>
<p>This input is the ratio of the modified outdoor air flow rate to the maximum outdoor air flow rate. When the high humidity control algorithm determines that the outdoor air flow rate will be changed (i.e., increased or decreased), the operating outdoor air flow rate is equal to the maximum outdoor air flow rate multiplied by this ratio. The minimum value for this field is 0. If this field is blank, the default value is 1. This field is used only when the input field High Humidity Control is specified as Yes. When an economizer is used in conjunction with the high humidity control option, high humidity control has priority.</p>
<h4 id="field-control-high-indoor-humidity-based-on-outdoor-humidity-ratio">Field: Control High Indoor Humidity Based on Outdoor Humidity Ratio</h4>
<p>This choice field determines if high humidity control is activated based on high indoor relative humidity alone or is activated only when the indoor relative humidity is above the humidstat setpoint <em>and</em> the indoor humidity ratio is greater than the outdoor humidity ratio. Valid choices are <strong>Yes</strong> and <strong>No</strong>. If No is selected, high humidity control is active any time the zone humidistat senses a moisture load. If Yes is selected, the model also verifies that the outdoor humidity ratio is less than the humidistat’s zone air humidity ratio. This field is used only when the input field High Humidity Control is specified as Yes. The default value is <strong>Yes</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="field-heat-recovery-bypass-control-type">Field: Heat Recovery Bypass Control Type</h4>
<p>This choice field determines if specialized control is used to optimize the use of heat recovery. Valid choices are <strong>BypassWhenWithinEconomizerLimits</strong> and <strong>BypassWhenOAFlowGreaterThanMinimum</strong>. If BypassWhenWithinEconomizerLimits is selected, heat recovery is disabled any time the controller determines that the economizer is active (i.e., all controls are within limits). If BypassWhenOAFlowGreaterThanMinimum is selected, the model first verifies that the economizer is active and then checks to see if the outdoor air flow rate is greater than the minimum, if so heat recovery is set to bypass whether or not a heat exchanger is used in the outdoor air system. When this option is used with Time of Day Economizer Control or High Humidity Control, this option has priority. The model then compares the mixed air temperature at minimum outdoor air flow with the heat exchanger off to the mixed air temperature set point. If the mixed air temperature at minimum outdoor air flow with the heat exchanger off is less than the mixed air temperature set point, the outdoor air flow rate is set to the minimum. The model then checks to see if an air loop heating coil is operating. If any airloop heating coil turns on, the heat exchanger is also turned on and the outdoor air flow is set to the minimum. This action is meant to minimize heating energy (this action may also disable the heating coil on subsequent iterations, see output variable Air System Outdoor Air Heat Recovery Bypass Heating Coil Activity Status). This means that heat recovery is active any time the outdoor air flow rate is equal to the minimum even when the economizer requests free cooling. For this case, the use of supply air temperature control for the heat exchanger is recommended (Ref HeatExchanger). The default value is <strong>BypassWhenWithinEconomizerLimits</strong>.</p>

The economizer status is set to 1 when the conditions are favorable for the economizer to operate (i.e., none of the control limits have been exceeded). While conditions may be favorable for economizer operation, it does not guarantee that the air-side economizer has increased outdoor air flow above the minimum level since the actual outdoor air flow rate is also governed by other controls (e.g., mixed air set point tempeature, time of day economizer control, maximum humidity setpoint, etc.).

<h3 id="controllermechanicalventilation">Controller:MechanicalVentilation</h3>
<p>This object is used in conjunction with an outdoor air controller (Ref. Controller:OutdoorAir, Field: Mechanical Ventilation Controller Name) to establish the minimum outdoor air flow rate provided by a mixed air box.</p>
<p>Ventilation standards provide guidance on appropriate levels of outdoor ventilation air required for acceptable indoor air quality. The Ventilation Rate Procedure (VRP) of ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2007/2010 (<a href="http://www.ashrae.org">www.ashrae.org</a>) requires outdoor ventilation rates to be determined based on the floor area of each occupied zone plus the number of people in each zone and considers the zone air distribution effectiveness and system ventilation efficiency. The outdoor air ventilation rate can be reset dynamically as operating conditions change (e.g., variations in occupancy). The Controller:MechanicalVentilation object implements the VRP for calculating these outdoor air ventilation requirements and resetting them based on varying occupancy levels and zone diversification. This is particularly useful for large air distribution systems that serve a number of different zone types with varying occupancy levels. This object can also be used to model the Indoor Air Quality Procedure (IAQP) as defined in Standard 62.1</p>
<h4 id="the-first-five-inputs-for-this-object-are-the-name-the-availability-schedule-the-zone-outdoor-air-method-the-system-outdoor-air-method-and-the-zone-maximum-outdoor-air-fraction-the-next-three-input-fields-define-the-zone-name-or-zone-list-name-the-design-specification-outdoor-air-object-name-and-the-design-specification-zone-air-distribution-object-name-to-be-applied-to-this-zone-or-zone-list-the-last-three-fields-are-extensible">The first five inputs for this object are the name, the availability schedule, the zone outdoor air method, the system outdoor air method, and the zone maximum outdoor air fraction. The next three input fields define the zone name (or zone list name), the design specification outdoor air object name, and the design specification zone air distribution object name to be applied to this zone (or zone list). The last three fields are extensible</h4>
<h4 id="field-name_133">Field: Name</h4>
<p>The unique user assigned name for an instance of mechanical ventilation. Any other object referencing this mechanical ventilation object will use this name.</p>
<h4 id="field-availabilityschedule-name">Field: AvailabilitySchedule Name</h4>
<p>The name of a schedule whose values are greater than 0 when mechanical ventilation, as calculated by this object, is desired. If the schedule’s value is 0.0, then mechanical ventilation is not available and flow will not be requested. If the schedule’s value is &gt; 0.0 (usually 1 is used), mechanical ventilation is available. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods. This schedule is useful for purging the building of contaminants prior to occupancy (i.e., ventilation rate per unit floor area will be provided even if the occupancy is zero).</p>
<h4 id="field-demand-controlled-ventilation">Field: Demand Controlled Ventilation</h4>
<p>This field indicates whether the air loop is capable of doing demand controlled ventilation (DCV) to vary the amount of outdoor air based on actual number of occupants in spaces. Two choices: Yes and No. Default is No.</p>
<h4 id="field-system-outdoor-air-method">Field: System Outdoor Air  Method</h4>
<p>The method used to calculate the system minimum outdoor air flow. Several choices are allowed: <strong>ZoneSum</strong>, <strong>VentilationRateProcedure,</strong> <strong>IndoorAirQualityProcedure,  ProportionalControl,</strong> and <strong>IndoorAirQualityProcedureGenericContaminant</strong>.  ZoneSum sums the outdoor air flows across all zones served by the system. VentilationRateProcedure (VRP) uses the multi-zone equations defined in 62.1-2007 to calculate the system outdoor air flow. VRP considers zone air distribution effectiveness and zone diversification of outdoor air fractions. IndoorAirQualityProcedure (IAQP) is the other procedure defined in ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2007 for calculate the amount of outdoor air necessary to maintain the levels of indoor air carbon dioxide at or below the setpoint defined in the ZoneControl:ContaminantController object. Appendix A of the ASHRAE 62.1-2010 user’s manual discusses another method for implementing CO<sub>2</sub>-based DCV in a single zone system. This method (Proportional Control) calculates the required outdoor air flow rate which varies in proportion to the percentage of the CO<sub>2</sub> signal range. The IndoorAirQualityProcedure-GenericContaminant method calculates the amount of outdoor air necessary to maintain the levels of indoor air generic contaminant at or below the setpoint defined in the ZoneControl:ContaminantController object.</p>
<p>Note: When System Outdoor Air Method = IndoorAirQualityProcedure or IndoorAirQualityProcedureGenericContaminant is specified, only the Zone &lt;x&gt; Name fields are used. The other field inputs described below are not used.</p>
<h4 id="field-zone-maximum-outdoor-air-fraction">Field: Zone Maximum Outdoor Air Fraction</h4>
<p>This positive numeric input is the zone maximum outdoor air fraction. For VAV systems, when a zone requires outdoor air higher than the user specified Zone Maximum Outdoor Air Fraction, the zone supply air flow will be increased (if damper not fully open yet) to cap the outdoor air fraction at the maximum value. This allows the system level outdoor air flow to be reduced while the total supply air flow increases to meet zone outdoor air requirement. Valid values are from 0 to 1.0. Default is 1.0 which indicates zones can have 100% outdoor air maintaining backward compatibility. This inputs work for single and dual duct VAV systems.</p>
<h4 id="field-set-zone-name-design-specification-outdoor-air-object-name-and-design-specification-zone-air-distribution-object-name">Field Set (Zone Name, Design Specification Outdoor Air Object Name, and Design Specification Zone Air Distribution Object Name)</h4>
<p>The following three fields are needed to define the parameters for the ventilation. This object is extensible by duplicating these three fields.</p>
<h4 id="fieldzone-x-name">Field:Zone &lt;x&gt; Name</h4>
<p>The zone name or zone list to apply the ventilation rates specified in the DesignSpecification:OutdoorAir object.</p>
<h4 id="field-design-specification-outdoor-air-object-name-x">Field: Design Specification Outdoor Air Object Name &lt;x&gt;</h4>
<p>The name of the DesignSpecification:OutdoorAir object, defining the amount of outdoor air, that applies to the zone or zone list. If this field is blank, the corresponding DesignSpecification:OutdoorAir object for the zone will come from the DesignSpecification:OutdoorAir object referenced by the Sizing:Zone object for the same zone. If no such zone match is found, default values from the IDD will be used for the DesignSpecification:OutdoorAir object.</p>
<h4 id="field-design-specification-zone-air-distribution-object-name-x">Field: Design Specification Zone Air Distribution Object Name &lt;x&gt;</h4>
<p>The name of the DesignSpecification:ZoneAirDistribution object, defining the air distribution effectiveness and secondary recirculation air fraction, that applies to the zone or zone list. If this field is blank, the corresponding DesignSpecification:ZoneAirDistribution object for the zone will come from the DesignSpecification:ZoneAirDistribution object referenced by the Sizing:Zone object for the same zone. If no such zone match is found, default values from the IDD will be used for the DesignSpecification:ZoneAirDistribution object.</p>
<p>As described previously, the Controller:MechanicalVentilation object works in conjunction with Controller:OutdoorAir. As such, the minimum quantity of outdoor air delivered via the mixed air box will be the greater of:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the minimum outdoor air flow rate calculated by the fields Minimum Outdoor Air Flow Rate, Minimum Limit and Minimum Outdoor Air Schedule Name in the associated Controller:OutdoorAir object, or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the outdoor air flow rate calculated by the VRP (details in the Engineering Reference) with inputs specified in this object and the referenced DesignSpecification:OutdoorAir and DesignSpecification:ZoneAirDistribution objects.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The actual outdoor air flow rate may be higher than the minimum if free cooling is available. Regardless, the outdoor air flow rate will not exceed the Maximum Outdoor Air Flow Rate specified in the associated Controller:OutdoorAir object.</p>

<h3 id="zonehvacenergyrecoveryventilatorcontroller">ZoneHVAC:EnergyRecoveryVentilator:Controller</h3>
<p>This controller object is used exclusively by the stand alone energy recovery ventilator (ZoneHVAC:EnergyRecoveryVentilator, see Figure 143). The purpose of this controller is to simulate economizer operation for the stand alone ERV and provide free cooling whenever possible or modify the outdoor air flow rate during high indoor humidity conditions. During economizer operation, if all of the limits are satisfied, the controller activates economizer mode (fully bypassing the fixed-plate air-to-air heat exchanger or stopping the rotation of a rotary heat exchanger). If any of the selected limits are exceeded, economizer operation is terminated. A time-of-day schedule may also be used to simulate a “push-button” type economizer controller.</p>
<p>In addition, the outdoor air flow rate may be modified and heat exchange suspended in response to high indoor relative humidities. When the indoor relative humidity exceeds the zone humidistat’s relative humidity set point, high humidity control is activated. When activated, if high humidity control is based on the outdoor air humidity ratio and the outdoor humidity ratio is greater than the indoor humidity ratio, high humidity control is terminated.</p>

<h4 id="field-name_134">Field: Name</h4>
<p>A unique user-assigned name for the stand alone ERV controller. Any reference to this controller by another object will use this name.</p>
<h4 id="field-temperature-high-limit">Field: Temperature High Limit</h4>
<p>The input for this field is the outdoor air temperature high limit (°C) for economizer operation. If the outdoor air temperature is above this limit, economizer (free cooling) operation is terminated. No input (blank) in this field means that there is no outdoor air temperature high limit control.</p>
<h4 id="field-temperature-low-limit">Field: Temperature Low Limit</h4>
<p>The input for this field is the outdoor air temperature low limit (°C) for economizer operation. If the outdoor air temperature is below this limit, economizer (free cooling) operation is terminated. No input (blank) in this field means that there is no outdoor air temperature low limit control.</p>
<h4 id="field-enthalpy-high-limit">Field: Enthalpy High Limit</h4>
<p>The input for this field is the outdoor air enthalpy limit (in J/kg) for economizer operation. If the outdoor air enthalpy is above this value, economizer (free cooling) operation is terminated. No input (blank) in this field means that there is no outdoor air economizer limit control.</p>
<h4 id="field-dewpoint-temperature-limit">Field: Dewpoint Temperature Limit</h4>
<p>Input for this field is the outdoor air dewpoint limit (°C) for economizer operation. If the outdoor air dewpoint temperature is above this value, the outdoor airflow rate will be set to the minimum. No input (blank) in this field means that there is no outdoor air dewpoint limit control. This limit applies to the conditions at the Actuated Node regardless of whether or not there are any other components on the outdoor air path upstream of the mixer.</p>
<h4 id="field-electronic-enthalpy-limit-curve-name_1">Field: Electronic Enthalpy Limit Curve Name</h4>
<p>Input for this field is the name of a quadratic or cubic curve which provides the maximum outdoor air humidity ratio (function of outdoor air dry-bulb temperature) for economizer operation. If the outdoor air humidity ratio is greater than the curve’s maximum humidity ratio (evaluated at the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature), the outdoor air flow rate will be set to the minimum. This limit applies to the conditions at the Actuated Node regardless of whether or not there are any other components on the outdoor air path upstream of the mixer. No input (blank) in this field means that there is no electronic enthalpy limit control.</p>
<h4 id="field-exhaust-air-temperature-limit">Field: Exhaust Air Temperature Limit</h4>
<p>This input establishes whether or not there is a limit control on the exhaust air temperature. The choices are <strong>ExhaustAirTemperatureLimit</strong> or <strong>NoExhaustAirTemperatureLimit</strong>. If <strong>ExhaustAirTemperatureLimit</strong> is chosen, the controller deactivates economizer mode whenever the outdoor air temperature is greater than the exhaust air temperature. If <strong>NoExhaustAirTemperatureLimit</strong> is chosen, no limit check on the exhaust air temperature is performed.</p>
<h4 id="field-exhaust-air-enthalpy-limit">Field: Exhaust Air Enthalpy Limit</h4>
<p>This input establishes whether or not there is a limit control on the exhaust air enthalpy. The choices are <strong>ExhaustAirEnthalpyLimit</strong> or <strong>NoExhaustAirEnthalpyLimit</strong>. If <strong>ExhaustAirEnthalpyLimit</strong> is chosen, the controller deactivates economizer mode whenever the outdoor air enthalpy is greater than the exhaust air enthalpy. If <strong>NoExhaustAirEnthalpyLimit</strong> is chosen, no limit check on the exhaust air enthalpy is performed.</p>
<h4 id="field-time-of-day-economizer-flow-control-schedule-name">Field: Time of Day Economizer Flow Control Schedule Name</h4>
<p>This alpha field is the name of a schedule which controls the change in air flow rate based on time-of-day. Schedule values equal to 0 disable this feature. Schedule values greater than 0 activate the economizer. Note that heat exchange between the air streams is suspended when the economizer is active. This schedule can be used with or without the high humidity control option. When an economizer is used in conjunction with the high humidity control option, high humidity control has priority.</p>
<h4 id="field-high-humidity-control-flag">Field: High Humidity Control Flag</h4>
<p>This optional choice field establishes whether or not the supply and exhaust air flow rates are modified in response to high indoor relative humidity. Valid choices are Yes and No. If Yes is selected, the supply and exhaust air flow rates may be modified when the indoor relative humidity is above the humidstat set point. If No is selected, this option is disabled and the following three fields are not used. Note that heat exchange between the air streams is suspended during times when high humidity control is active. The default value is No.</p>
<h4 id="field-humidistat-control-zone-name_1">Field: Humidistat Control Zone Name</h4>
<p>This optional input defines the zone name where the humidistat is located. This is the same zone name used in the Zone Control:Humidistat object. This field is required when the High Humidity Control Flag is specified as Yes.</p>
<h4 id="field-high-humidity-outdoor-air-flow-ratio_1">Field: High Humidity Outdoor Air Flow Ratio</h4>
<p>This optional input is the ratio of the modified supply (outdoor) air flow rate to the supply air flow rate specified in the Energy Recovery Ventilator:Stand Alone ERV object. When the high humidity control algorithm determines that the supply air flow rate will be changed (i.e. increased or decreased), the operating supply air flow rate is equal to the supply air flow rate specified in the Energy Recovery Ventilator:Stand Alone ERV object multiplied by this ratio. The minimum value for this field is 0. This field is used to modify both the supply and exhasut air flow rates when high humidity control is active. The supply and exhasut air fan volumetric flow rates must be able to account for the increase in air flow when this input is greater than 1. The default value is 1.</p>
<h4 id="field-control-high-indoor-humidity-based-on-outdoor-humidity-ratio_1">Field: Control High Indoor Humidity based on Outdoor Humidity Ratio</h4>
<p>This optional choice field determines if high humidity control is activated based on high indoor relative humidity alone or is activated only when the indoor relative humidity is above the humidstat set point <em>and</em> the outdoor humidity ratio is less than the indoor humidity ratio. Valid choices are Yes and No. If No is selected, high humidity control is active any time the zone humidistat senses a moisture load. If yes is selected, the model also verifies that the outdoor humidity ratio is less than the humidistat’s zone air humidity ratio. This field is used only when the High Humidity Control Flag is specified as Yes. The default value is Yes.</p>

<p>This group of objects describes the properties and configuration for the evaporative coolers models for the HVAC section.</p>
<h3 id="evaporativecoolerdirectceldekpad">EvaporativeCooler:Direct:CelDekPad</h3>
<p>The direct stage, shown in the figure below, consists of a rigid media evaporative pad, with water recirculated from a reservoir.  The water is pumped from the reservoir to a water distribution header, for water feed by gravity from above the media.  The evaporative pad provides the area for the adiabatic saturation of the air.  While the process provides a lower dry-bulb temperature, the moisture content of the leaving air is higher than the entering condition.  The direct stage is used for comfort cooling in a building where adding humidity to the air can be tolerated.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../InputOutputReference/media/image415.svg" /></p>
<p>Figure 144.  Direct Stage Evaporative Cooler</p>
<p>The thermodynamic process is a simultaneous heat and mass transfer, or adiabatic cooling, and follows a constant enthalpy line on the psychrometric chart, it is shown in the figure below as a process from A to B.  Since the deviation of the constant wet-bulb line and the constant enthalpy line is small, it is assumed that the wet-bulb temperature is constant across the direct evaporative stage.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../InputOutputReference/media/image416.svg" /></p>
<p>Figure 145.  Psychrometric Chart -- Constant Enthalpy</p>

<p>The model allows to vary the effectiveness depending on the primary air flow rates.  The design effectiveness is modified by multiplying with Effectiveness Flow Fraction Modifier Curve value.  The flow fraction is the ratio of the current primary airflow rate to the design flow rate. The recirculating and spray water pump power is assumed to vary with the primary air flow.  The design pump power is modified using user specified pump modifier curve value.  The normalized pump power modifier curve is a function of primary air flow fraction as a independent variable. </p>
<p>Also the direct evaporative cooler operating range can be controlled depending on the entering air dry bulb and wet bulb temperatures.  The operating range controlled based on minimum and maximum inlet node air temperature limits.  The evaporative cooler can be turned on or off depending user specified minimum and maximum temperature limits.  If the inlet node entering air temperature is lower or higher than the minimum and maximum limits, respectively, then the direct research special evaporative cooler is turned off.

<h3 id="evaporativecoolerindirectceldekpad">EvaporativeCooler:Indirect:CelDekPad</h3>
<p>The dry coil indirect evaporative cooler, shown in the figure below, has a rigid media pad, similar to the direct evaporative stage, where the adiabatic cooling takes place. The secondary air leaves the rigid media pad and enters an air to air heat exchanger where it cools the supply air flowing through the heat exchanger tubes. The moist secondary air is then exhausted to the environment. The secondary air stream has its own fan and consists of a rigid media evaporative pad, with water recirculated from a reservoir. The water is pumped from the reservoir to a water distribution header, for water feed by gravity from above the media. The evaporative pad provides the area for the adiabatic saturation of the air.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../InputOutputReference/media/image419.svg" /></p>
<p>Figure 146. Evaporative Cooler -- Indirect Dry Coil</p>
<p>The process that the secondary air goes through, A to C to D, is shown by the dashed lines in  the following figure. Process A to C is adiabatic cooling in the rigid media pad. Then the air enters the shell side of the heat exchanger and is sensibly heated from C to D by the warm supply air passing through the tube side. The secondary air inlet is modeled as a separate stream of outdoor air and the user has the option of defining the name of an outdoor air node.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../InputOutputReference/media/image420.svg" /></p>
<p>Figure 147. Secondary Air Process -- Indirect Dry Coil Evap Cooler</p>
<p>The advantage of the dry coil heat exchanger is that the heat exchanger does not have the evaporation taking place on the outside of the tubes, thus no mineral deposits are left on the heat exchange surface to reduce the efficiency of the heat exchanger. The rigid media pads are designed to flush the mineral deposits to the sump, so the saturation efficiency of the pad stays relatively constant.</p>

<p>The wet coil heat exchanger can have a higher stage efficiency than the dry coil due to a higher heat transfer rate on the outside of the heat exchanger tubes. Over the operating lifetime of the heat exchanger, the vaporization taking place on the heat exchange surface can leave mineral deposits which will decrease the effectiveness of the heat exchanger.</p>
<h4 id="field-name_138">Field: Name</h4>
<p>A unique identifying name for each evaporative cooler.</p>
<h4 id="fieldavailability-schedule-name_8">Field:Availability Schedule Name</h4>
<p>The name of a schedule which defines when the evaporative cooler is available. A schedule value of 0 indicates that the evaporative cooler is off for that time period. A schedule value greater than 0 indicates that the evaporative cooler can operate during the time period. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.</p>
<h4 id="field-coil-maximum-efficiency">Field: Coil Maximum Efficiency</h4>
<p>The maximum efficiency of the stage is a combination of the efficiency due to the simultaneous heat and mass transfer on the outside of the tube and the efficiency of the heat exchanger. This value can be higher than the dry coil overall efficiency since the convective coefficients on the outside of the tube are larger.</p>
<h4 id="field-coil-flow-ratio">Field: Coil Flow Ratio</h4>
<p>The Coil Flow Ratio is determined from performance data. The Coil Flow Ratio tells how quickly the efficiency of the stage would decrease with a mismatch of the supply and secondary flows.</p>
<h4 id="field-recirculating-water-pump-power-consumption_2">Field: Recirculating Water Pump Power Consumption</h4>
<p>This field is used to specify the power consumed by the evaporative cooler recirculating pump in Watts.</p>

<p>This field is used to specify the secondary fan flow rate and is specified in m<sup>3</sup>/sec.</p>
<h4 id="field-secondary-fan-total-efficiency_1">Field: Secondary Fan Total Efficiency</h4>
<p>This value is the overall efficiency of the fan, i.e., the ratio of the power delivered to the fluid to the electrical input power. It is the product of the motor efficiency and the impeller efficiency. The motor efficiency is the power delivered to the shaft divided by the electrical power input to the motor. The impeller efficiency is power delivered to the fluid (air) divided by the shaft power. The power delivered to the fluid is the mass flow rate of the air multiplied by the pressure rise divided by the air density. This input value must be between 0 and 1..</p>

<p>This field is optional. It is used to describe where the cooler obtains water used for evaporative cooling. If blank or omitted, then the cooler will obtain water directly from the mains. If the name of a WaterUse:Storage object is used here, then the cooler will obtain its water from that tank. If a tank is specified, the cooler will attempt to obtain all the water it uses from the tank. However if the tank cannot provide all the water the cooler needs, then the cooler will still operate and obtain the rest of the water it needs from the mains.</p>
<h4 id="field-secondary-air-inlet-node-name_3">Field: Secondary Air Inlet Node Name</h4>
<p>This field is optional. It is used to explicitly define an outdoor air node for the inlet for secondary air stream. Defining an outdoor air node here allows using the height-dependent model for outdoor air conditions.</p>
<h4 id="field-drift-loss-fraction_1">Field: Drift Loss Fraction</h4>
<p>This field is optional and can be used to model additional water consumed by the cooler from drift.  Drift is water that leaves the cooling media as droplets and does not evaporate into the process air stream.  For example, water may get blown off the evaporative media by winds and escape the air system.  The value entered here is a simple fraction of the water consumed by the cooler for normal process evaporation.  The amount of drift is this fraction times the water evaporated for the normal cooling process.  This field can be left blank and then there will be no added water consumption from drift.</p>
<h4 id="field-blowdown-concentration-ratio_1">Field: Blowdown Concentration Ratio</h4>
<p>This field is optional and can be used to model additional water consumed by the cooler from blowdown.  Blowdown is water that is intentionally drained from the cooler’s sump to offset the build up of solids in the water that would otherwise occur because of evaporation.  The value entered here is dimensionless.  It can be characterized as the ratio of solids in the blowdown water to solids in the make up water.  Typical values are 3 to 5.  The default is 3.0.</p>

<h3 id="evaporativecoolerindirectresearchspecial">EvaporativeCooler:Indirect:ResearchSpecial</h3>
<p>This cooler is similar in principal to the EvaporativeCooler:Indirect:CelDekPad and EvaporativeCooler:Indirect:WetCoil (see Figure 147, Figure 148, and Figure 149). The model differs in that it gives the user more flexibility to specify the source of secondary air. The cooler effectiveness with respect to wetbulb depression is allowed to go beyond 1.0. Using the ResearchSpecial input object also allows the cooler to control the amount of cooling based on node setpoints (controlled by SetpointManagers). This avoid problems from over cooling when conditions are such that loads are low and cooling power is high. Fan power is assumed to vary linearly when the cooler is operating at less than full capacity.</p>
<p>The indirect evaporative cooler research special calculation procedure allows accounting for dry and wet effectiveness value variation with flow fraction.  Two effectiveness modifier curves are included as optional user inputs for this purpose.  Effectiveness modifier curves operate on the design dry and wet effectiveness values. The flow fraction is calculated as a ratio of the sum of current primary and secondary air flow rates to the sum of the design flow rates. Model also accounts for fan and recirculation water pump power variation with secondary air flow rates using pump power modifying curve. The fan power is calculated by multiplying the design fan power using fan power modify curve value evaluated at current secondary air flow fraction. Similarly, recirculating pump power is is calculated by multiplying the design pump power by pump power modifier curve value evaluated at current secondary air flow fraction. If the secondary air fan and recirculating pump power modifier curves are not specified, then fan and pump power are assumed to vary linearly with part load fraction.</p>

<p>The air-to-air flat plate heat exchanger is an HVAC component typically used for exhaust or relief air heat recovery. The user can choose the flow arrangement type: counter flow, parallel flow, or cross flow with both streams unmixed. The input requires no geometric data. Performance is defined by specifying primary outlet air temperature at nominal (user specified) inlet conditions. In addition, the ratio (h<sup>.</sup>A)<sub>p</sub> / (h<sup>.</sup>A)<sub>s</sub> at nominal flow needs to be input, where h is the convective heat transfer  coefficient, A is the surface area, p stands for primary side, s for secondary side.</p>
<p>If the heat exchanger is operated in conjunction with an outdoor air economizer (economizer lockout set to <em>Yes</em>), the nominal supply air flow rate should be set equal to the minimum outdoor air flow rate specified in the Controller:OutdoorAir.

<p>The sensible and latent air-to-air heat exchanger is an HVAC component typically used for exhaust or relief air heat recovery (Figure 150). Heat exchanger performance can be specified to transfer sensible energy, latent energy or both between the supply and exhaust air streams. The input requires no geometric data. Performance is defined by specifying sensible and/or latent effectiveness at 75% and 100% of the nominal (rated) supply air flow rate at two operating conditions as shown in Table 30.</p>

<p>This object models the basic operation of an air-to-air heat exchanger. Heat exchange between the supply and exhaust air streams occurs whenever the unit is scheduled to be available (Availability schedule) and supply/exhaust air flow is present. This heat exchanger object can be used in conjunction with a conventional air-side economizer (i.e., specify ModulateFlow in the Controller:OutdoorAir object), whereby heat exchange is suspended whenever the air-side economizer (or high humidity control) is active (i.e., air flow is fully bypassed around a fixed-plate heat exchanger or the rotation of a rotary heat exchanger is stopped). This object is also able to suspend heat exchange for the purpose of providing free cooling operation in the absence of a conventional air-side economizer (i.e., specify MinimumFlowWithBypass in the Controller:OutdoorAir object).</p>
<p>During winter weather, humid exhaust air entering the heat exchanger can form frost on the cold heat exchanger surfaces, which can reduce air flow and the amount of energy recovery. Several methods are used to control or eliminate frost formation, and the following types can be modeled for this heat exchanger object: supply air preheat, minimum exhaust air temperature, exhaust air recirculation and exhaust only. For preheat frost control, a separate heating coil object must be placed in the supply inlet air stream to keep the air temperature above the frost threshold temperature. The other frost control types are modeled within this object itself (i.e., do not require a separate object to be defined) based on alpha and numeric inputs to this heat exchanger object.</p>
<p>Air-to-air heat exchangers are sometimes controlled to maintain a fixed supply air outlet temperature to avoid overheating when the heat exchanger is heating the supply (primary) air. To model this control in EnergyPlus, a set point manager object is used to establish a temperature set point at the supply air outlet node of the heat exchanger. Wheel speed modulation or plate supply air bypass is used to control the supply air exiting conditions to this set point. The set point for supply air temperature control should be set at the minimum economizer temperature set point if an air-side economizer is also being used by the air system. If frost control and supply air outlet temperature control are used, frost control takes precedence over supply air temperature control (e.g., frost control defrost time fraction is determined as if wheel speed modulation or plate supply air bypass is not used).</p>
<p>To model a sensible and latent air-to-air heat exchanger located in an air loop, the input data file should include the following objects:</p>

<p>The name of the HVAC system node from which the unit draws its supply (primary) inlet air.</p>
<h4 id="field-supply-air-outlet-node-name_1">Field: Supply Air Outlet Node Name</h4>
<p>The name of the HVAC system node to which the unit sends its supply (primary) outlet air.</p>
<h4 id="field-exhaust-air-inlet-node-name">Field: Exhaust Air Inlet Node Name</h4>

<h4 id="field-exhaust-air-outlet-node-name">Field: Exhaust Air Outlet Node Name</h4>
<p>The name of the HVAC system node to which the unit sends its exhaust (secondary) outlet air.</p>
<h4 id="field-nominal-electric-power_1">Field: Nominal Electric Power</h4>
<p>The electric consumption rate of the unit in watts. Electric power is considered constant whenever the unit operates. This numeric input can be used to model electric power consumption by controls (transformers, relays, etc.) and/or a motor for a rotary heat exchanger. None of this electric power contributes thermal load to the supply or exhaust air streams. The default value for this field is 0.</p>
<h4 id="field-supply-air-outlet-temperature-control">Field: Supply Air Outlet Temperature Control</h4>
<p>This alpha field determines if the heat exchanger’s supply air outlet is controlled to a temperature set point when the heat exchanger is heating the supply (primary) air. The choices for this input field are “Yes” or “No”, with the default being “No”. When supply air outlet temperature control is used, the wheel rotational speed modulates or supply air is bypassed around the plate heat exchanger to maintain the desired setpoint temperature. A setpoint manager object is required to establish the desired set point at the supply air outlet node (reference: SetpointManager:Scheduled). When an air-side economizer is also being modeled for this air system, the set point for the supply air outlet temperature control should be equal to the economizer outdoor air temperature lower limit (reference: Controller:OutdoorAir, field Economizer Minimum Limit Dry-Bulb Temperature).</p>
<h4 id="field-heat-exchanger-type">Field: Heat Exchanger Type</h4>
<p>This alpha field denotes the type of heat exchanger being modeled: Plate (e.g., fixed plate) or Rotary (e.g., rotating cylinder or wheel). The default choice for this field is “Plate”. The heat exchanger type affects the modeling of frost control options and supply air outlet temperature control. For rotary heat exchangers, rotational speed is varied to control frost formation or the supply air outlet temperature. For plate exchangers, air bypass around the heat exchanger is used to obtain the desired effect.</p>
<h4 id="field-frost-control-type">Field: Frost Control Type</h4>
<p>This alpha field has four choices: None, ExhaustAirRecirculation, ExhaustOnly and MinimumExhaustTemperature. If this field is left blank, the default frost control type is “None”. For modeling preheat frost control, specify “None” for this input field and insert a separate heating coil object in the supply inlet air stream to keep the air temperature above the desired frost threshold temperature.</p>
<p><em>ExhaustAirRecirculation</em>: dampers are used to direct exhaust air back into the zone through the supply side of the heat exchanger when the supply (outdoor) air inlet temperature falls below a threshold temperature (defined in the next input field). The fraction of time that exhaust air is circulated through the supply side of the heat exchanger is dependent on the supply (outdoor) air inlet temperature with respect to the threshold temperature, the initial defrost time fraction, and the rate of change of defrost time fraction (see <em>Field: Rate of Defrost Time Fraction Increase</em>). When exhaust air is being recirculated, no supply (outdoor ventilation) air is being provided through the heat exchanger unit (which may or may not be acceptable regarding ventilation for occupants).</p>
<p><em>ExhaustOnly (supply air bypass)</em>: this control cycles off the supply air flow through the heat exchanger for a certain period of time while the exhaust air continues to flow through the exhaust side of the heat exchanger. The fraction of time that the supply flow through the heat exchanger is cycled off is dependent on the supply (outdoor) air inlet temperature with respect to the threshold temperature, the initial defrost time fraction, and the rate of change of defrost time fraction (see <em>Field: Rate of Defrost Time Fraction Increase</em>). When implemented in real applications, provisions are usually made to avoid building depressurization when this frost control is operating (automatic or pressure-operated dampers, or a bypass air damper around the supply side of the heat exchanger). For this frost control type, it is assumed that the supply air is bypassed around the heat exchanger during frost control operation (i.e., the total supply flow is not reduced during defrost, but merely bypassed around the heat exchanger).</p>
<p><em>MinimumExhaustTemperature</em>: the temperature of the exhaust air leaving the heat exchanger is monitored and the heat exchanger effectiveness is decreased (by slowing heat exchanger rotation or bypassing supply air around the plate exchanger) to keep the exhaust air from falling below the threshold temperature.</p>
<h4 id="field-threshold-temperature">Field: Threshold Temperature</h4>
<p>This numeric field defines the dry-bulb temperature of air which is used to initiate frost control. The default value is 1.7ºC. For ExhaustAirRecirculation and ExhaustOnly frost control, the threshold temperature defines the supply (outdoor) air inlet temperature below which frost control is active. For MinimumExhaustTemperature frost control, heat exchanger effectiveness is controlled to keep the exhaust air outlet temperature from falling below this threshold temperature value.</p>
<p>The appropriate threshold temperature varies with exhaust (inlet) air temperature and humidity, frost control type, heat exchanger type, and whether the heat exchanger transfers sensible energy alone or both sensible and latent energy (enthalpy). Typical threshold temperatures are provided in Table 31 below. However, it is recommended that the user consult manufacturer’s information for the specific air-to-air heat exchanger being modeled.</p>

<p>** To model preheat frost control, specify frost control type as “None” and place a heating coil in the supply inlet air stream controlled to the keep the air temperature above the frost threshold temperature.</p>
<h4 id="field-initial-defrost-time-fraction">Field: Initial Defrost Time Fraction</h4>
<p>This numeric field defines the fraction of the simulation timestep when frost control will be invoked when the threshold temperature is reached. This field is only used for the ExhaustAirRecirculation and ExhaustOnly frost control types. The value for this field must be ≥ 0 and ≤ 1. The default time fraction is 0.083 (e.g., 5 min / 60 min) which is typical for ExhaustAirRecirculation frost control. Higher initial defrost time fractions (e.g., 0.167 = 10 min / 60 min) are typically required for ExhaustOnly frost control. For best results, the user should obtain this information from the manufacturer.</p>
<h4 id="field-rate-of-defrost-time-fraction-increase">Field: Rate of Defrost Time Fraction Increase</h4>
<p>This numeric field defines the rate of increase in the defrost time fraction as the supply (outdoor) air inlet temperature falls below the threshold temperature. This field is only used for the ExhaustAirRecirculation and ExhaustOnly frost control types. The value for this field must be ≥ 0. The default value is 0.012 (e.g., 0.72 min / 60 min per degree C temperature difference) which is typical for ExhaustAirRecirculation frost control. Higher values (e.g., 0.024 = 1.44 min / 60 min per degree C temperature difference) are typically required for ExhaustOnly frost control. For best results, the user should obtain this information from the manufacturer.</p>
<p>This value is used to determine the total defrost time fraction as follows:</p>
<p>Total defrost time fraction = Initial Defrost Time Fraction +</p>
<p>Rate of Defrost Time Fraction Increase * (T<sub>threshold</sub> – T<sub>supply\ air\ inlet</sub>)</p>
<p>The model does not allow the total defrost time fraction to exceed 1.0 or be less than 0.</p>

<p>This input denotes whether the heat exchanger unit is locked out (bypassed for plate type heat exchangers or the rotation is suspended for rotary type heat exchangers) when the air-side economizer is operating. Both the economizer and high humidity control (Ref. Controller:OutdoorAir) activate the heat exchanger lockout as specified by this input.

<p>This desiccant heat exchanger object is an HVAC component used to model both temperature (sensible) and moisture (latent) heat exchange between two air streams (Figure 151). The model assumes balanced air flow through the regeneration and process sides of the heat exchanger (i.e., regeneration and process air volume flow rates and face velocities are the same). Heat exchanger performance is specified through a performance data type object (e.g., HeatExchanger:Desiccant:BalancedFlow:PerformanceDataType1).</p>
<p><img alt="BalancedFlowDesiccantHeatExchanger_Schematic" src="../../InputOutputReference/media/image424.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 151. Schematic of the Balanced Flow Desiccant Heat Exchanger</p>
<p>Currently, this desiccant heat exchanger model can be referenced by two compound objects: CoilSystem:Cooling:DX:HeatExchangerAssisted and Dehumidifier:Desiccant:System, both of which are used to provide enhanced dehumidification over conventional systems. If this heat exchanger is referenced by a compound object, the compound object will control heat exchanger operation (i.e., tell the heat exchanger if heat exchange is needed or not for each simulation timestep).</p>
<p>This desiccant heat exchanger object may also be specified directly in an AirLoopHVAC (air loop BranchList) or in an AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem (AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem:EquipmentList) without being referenced by a compound object. If specified directly in an AirLoopHVAC or AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem, then the heat exchanger can be controlled to provide heat exchange based on a maximum and/or minimum humidity set point placed on the process air outlet node (ref. Setpoint Managers). If no humidity set points are provided on this node, then heat exchange will be provided whenever the heat exchanger is available to operate (via its availability schedule) and there is a temperature and/or humidity ratio difference between the two air streams.</p>

<h3 id="heatexchangerdesiccantbalancedflowperformancedatatype1">HeatExchanger:Desiccant:BalancedFlow:PerformanceDataType1</h3>
<p>This object specifies a performance model and model coefficients for a balanced flow desiccant heat exchanger. A HeatExchanger:Desiccant:BalancedFlow object will reference a HeatExchanger:Desiccant:BalancedFlow:PerformanceDataType1 object. This performance data object is used to specify the thermal performance and electric consumption of the heat exchanger. Some representative inputs for this object are provided in the EnergyPlus Reference DataSets (PerfCurves.idf and AllDataSets.idf).</p>
<p>This model predicts the regeneration air stream outlet temperature and humidity ratio values based on the entering regeneration and process air stream temperature, humidity ratio and face velocity. The process air stream outlet humidity ratio and temperatures are calculated based on a simple heat and moisture balance. The model requires that the user enter the nominal volumetric flow rate and a nominal face velocity, electric power consumption, empirical model coefficients for the regeneration outlet air temperature and humidity ratio equations, and the applicable minimum and maximum values for both the independent and dependent variables for the empirical model coefficients provided. This model is based on the following equations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The dry-bulb temperature of the regeneration outlet air is defined using the following equation:</li>
</ul>
<div>\[RTO = B1 + B2*RWI + B3*RTI + B4*\left( {\frac{{RWI}}{{RTI}}} \right) + B5*PWI + B6*PTI + B7*\left( {\frac{{PWI}}{{PTI}}} \right) + B8*RFV\]</div>

<p>where,</p>
<p><span>$RTO$</span> = Regeneration outlet air dry-bulb temperature (C)</p>
<p><span>$RWI$</span> = Regeneration inlet air humidity ratio (kgWater/kgDryAir)</p>
<p><span>$RTI$</span>  = Regeneration inlet air dry-bulb temperature (C)</p>
<p><span>$PWI$</span> = Process inlet air humidity ratio (kgWater/kgDryAir)</p>
<p><span>$PTI$</span>  = Process inlet air dry-bulb temperature (C)</p>
<p><span>$RFV$</span> = Regeneration (and process) face velocity (m/s)</p>
<ul>
<li>The humidity ratio of the regeneration outlet air is defined using the same empirical equation form; however, different coefficients are used as follows:</li>
</ul>
<div>\[RWO = C1 + C2*RWI + C3*RTI + C4*\left( {\frac{{RWI}}{{RTI}}} \right) + C5*PWI + C6*PTI + C7*\left( {\frac{{PWI}}{{PTI}}} \right) + C8*RFV\]</div>

<p>where,</p>
<p><span>$RWO$</span> = Regeneration outlet air humidity ratio (kgWater/kgDryAir)</p>
<ul>
<li>The process outlet air conditions are then calculated based on the regeneration outlet air conditions (temperature or humidity ratio) calculated above, the actual regeneration inlet air conditions entering the heat exchanger, and assuming the same amount of sensible and total energy transfer across both the process and regeneration sides of the heat exchanger. The difference between the actual inlet air conditions and RTI/RWI/PTI/PWI is made here because user-defined limits for RTI/RWI/PTI/PWI may result in a difference between the actual conditions and those used in the equations shown above (see the EnergyPlus Engineering Reference for further discussion).</li>

With this fixed face area, the air face velocity is calculated every simulation timestep based on the actual air volume flow rate for the timestep. The minimum value should be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 6. The default value is 3.0.</p>
<h4 id="field-nominal-electric-power_2">Field: Nominal Electric Power</h4>
<p>This numeric field contains the nominal electric consumption rate of the heat exchanger in watts.

<h2 id="group-demand-limiting-controls">Group – Demand Limiting Controls</h2>
<p>Demand limiting, or demand management, is a strategy for reducing a building's demand for utilities, e.g., electricity. Utility companies typically charge a monthly fee for "demand charges" that is based on the peak demand during a certain time period. Often the peak demand charge is set by one exceptional day that is much higher than the peak demand for an average day during the month. Therefore, to save utility costs, it is in the interest of building owners to find ways to manage the demand on peak days. While demand management is generally concerned with the demand for electricity, the future will likely see demand management of other utilities, such as natural gas or water.</p>
<p>Demand limiting controls shut off or reduce the power to non-essential loads in order to reduce the overall building demand. Some typical controls:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>shut off or dim electric lights, equipment, or HVAC systems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reset the thermostatic set points on HVAC systems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reduce the load of a set of similar components by rotating one or more components "off" for a short time interval</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>turn on generators to meet some or all of the building's demand.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The demand limiting controls implemented in EnergyPlus are intended to allow some of the more common demand limiting strategies. Currently, only Exterior:Lights, Lights, ElectricEquipment, and ZoneControl:Thermostat objects can be demand limited. Additional components will be demand limited in future releases.</p>
<h3 id="demandmanagerassignmentlist">DemandManagerAssignmentList</h3>
<p>The DemandManagerAssignmentList object is a high level control that makes demand limiting decisions based on a list of possible demand limiting strategies. Each demand limiting strategy is described in a separate DemandManager object. (This is structured like the relationship between the AvailabilityManagerAssignmentList and the AvailabilityManager  objects.)</p>
<p>Each DemandManagerAssignmentList monitors and demand limits one meter. Only electricity meters are currently allowed. In many cases, the meter will be <em>Electricity:Facility</em>. A schedule and safety factor are used to set the demand limit above which the DemandManagers become activated. The billing month schedule and demand window are also taken into account when calculating the demand limit.</p>
<p>DemandManagers in the list are activated based on the <em>Demand Manager Priority</em>. If the <strong>Sequential</strong> option is used, each manager in the list is activated in sequence from first to last until demand is reduced below the limit or until all managers are activated. If the <strong>All</strong> option is used, all managers are activated simultaneously to achieve the maximum demand reduction.</p>
<p>A DemandManager is skipped if it cannot reduce the demand. Possible reasons that a manager cannot reduce demand include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>not enough load to limit</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>not available because of its <em>Availability Schedule</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>already activated; load limited during a previous timestep.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="field-name_144">Field: Name</h4>
<p>The name of the DemandManagerAssignmentList object.</p>
<h4 id="field-meter-name">Field: Meter Name</h4>
<p>This field references the meter that is to be monitored and demand limited. Only electricity meters are currently allowed.</p>
<h4 id="field-demand-limit-schedule-name">Field: Demand Limit Schedule Name</h4>
<p>The reference to the schedule object specifying the target demand limits [schedule values should be in Watts].</p>
<h4 id="field-demand-limit-safety-fraction">Field: Demand Limit Safety Fraction</h4>
<p>This field is a multiplier that is applied to the target demand limit (above). When the metered demand exceeds (target demand limit * safety fraction), the DemandManagers begin to limit the demand. This helps to ensure that the target limit is not exceeded.</p>
<h4 id="field-billing-period-schedule-name">Field: Billing Period Schedule Name</h4>
<p>The reference to the schedule object that defines the monthly billing periods. The peak demand during the peak period of the billing period typically determines the demand charge. This should reference the same schedule that is used in the <em>Month Schedule Name</em> field of the UtilityCost:Tariff object. If left blank, it defaults to the regular divisions between months.</p>
<h4 id="field-peak-period-schedule-name">Field: Peak Period Schedule Name</h4>
<p>The reference to the schedule object that defines the peak/off-peak time-of-use periods. The peak demand during the peak period of the billing period typically determines the demand charge. This should reference the same schedule that is used in the <em>Time of Use Period Schedule Name</em> field of the UtilityCost:Tariff object. A value of 1 indicates the peak period; any other value is off-peak. If left blank, it defaults to always on the peak period. The DemandManagerAssignmentList only attempts to demand limit during peak periods.</p>
<h4 id="field-demand-window-length">Field: Demand Window Length</h4>
<p>This field is similar to the field of the same name in the UtilityCost:Tariff object. However, the user may not want to limit using the same demand window as the utility company. This field allows the user to input the number of minutes over which to calculate the current demand. The minutes are rounded to match the nearest multiple of time steps.</p>
<h4 id="field-demand-manager-priority">Field: Demand Manager Priority</h4>
<p>This field indicates what logic should be used to activate the individual DemandManagers in the list. <strong>Sequential</strong> treats the list of DemandManagers as a sequential priority list, i.e., the first DemandManager in the list is activated first, then the second, etc., until the demand falls below the limit. <strong>All</strong> activates all demand managers to achieve the maximum demand reduction.</p>
<h4 id="field-demand-manager-type-1">Field: Demand Manager Type 1</h4>
<p>The key word defining the type of DemandManager.</p>
<h4 id="field-demand-manager-name-1">Field: Demand Manager Name 1</h4>
<p>The name of a DemandManager object defined elsewhere in the input file.</p>
<p>DemandManagers are listed by pairs of data items:  <em>Demand Manager Type</em> and <em>Demand Manager Name</em>. Ten managers are accomodated in the list by default. The IDD specification, however, is extensible and additional pairs may be added by directly editing the IDD.</p>

<h2 id="group-electric-load-center-generator-specifications">Group -- Electric Load Center-Generator Specifications</h2>
<h3 id="electricloadcentertransformer">ElectricLoadCenter:Transformer</h3>
<p>This object is used to model the energy losses of transformers when they are used to transfer electricity from the grid to a building (as distribution transformers) or transfer electricity from onsite generators to the grid. Distribution transformers reduce the voltage on utility distribution lines (34.5 kV or less) to a lower secondary voltage (600 V or less) suitable for customer equipment. According to the medium used for cooling and insulation, distribution transformers can be classified into liquid-immersed and dry type transformers. According to the input voltages, distribution transformers can be classified into medium-voltage (between 600 V and 34.5kV) and low-voltage transformer (less than 600 V). The transformers used to output the surplus electricity from onsite generators to the grid usually match the cogeneration voltage to the grid. This object can be used for all types of distribution transformers and the transformers used to output electricity from onsite generators to the grid, but the model defaults applies to the low-voltage dry type transformers because they are the most common type found in commercial and industrial facilities.</p>
<p>Energy losses in transformers consist of the no load (core) loss and the load (winding) loss. The no load loss comes primarily from the switching of the magnetic fields in the core material. It is roughly constant and exists continuously in the core material as long as the transformer is energized. The load loss comes from the electrical resistance in the windings when there is a load on the transformer. The load loss is proportional to the load squared with a small temperature correction. The energy losses at a given load depend on the transformer’s performance. This object provides the user two alternative ways to indicate the transformer’s performance. First, the user can provide the no load loss and load loss at rated conditions. Second, the user can provide the nameplate efficiency and the corresponding reference conditions. The detailed algorithms to calculate the energy losses are described in the Engineering Reference.</p>
<p>The user needs to specify which loads are connected to the transformer. This is achieved in different manners depending on the transformer usage. For a distribution transformer, the user needs to provide a number of electric meters wired to that transformer. The input object can currently accommodate up to ten meters, but it is extensible by modifying the Energy+.idd entry. For a transformer used to output electricity from onsite generators to the grid, the user needs to indicate the transformer name in the served electric load center.</p>
<h4 id="field-availability-schedule-name_34">Field: Availability Schedule Name</h4>
<p>This alpha field contains the schedule name (ref. Schedule objects) that contains information on the availability of the transformer. A schedule value greater than 0 (usually 1 is used) indicates that the transformer is available to convert AC power from one voltage to another. A value less than or equal to 0 (usually 0 is used) denotes that the transformer is not available. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.</p>
<h4 id="field-transformer-usage">Field: Transformer Usage</h4>
<p>This field indicates one of the two supported transformer application types: PowerInFromGrid and PowerOutFromOnsiteGeneration. The first type of transformer is used to step down voltage from the electricity grid to a building. The second type of transformer is used to match voltage from building onsite generators to the electricity grid.</p>
<h4 id="field-zone-name_8">Field: Zone Name</h4>
<p>This field contains the name of the thermal zone where the transformer is located. Entering a valid name of zone here will direct EnergyPlus to include the transformer’s losses as heat gains to the named thermal zone. If the transformer is not within a thermal zone, this field can be left blank and the thermal energy associated with transformer losses is removed from the building model.</p>
<h4 id="field-radiative-fraction">Field: Radiative Fraction</h4>
<p>This field contains the fraction of transformer’s losses that enter the zone as long-wave thermal radiation. This numeric filed should have a value between 0.0 and 1.0. The balance of the losses is convective. This field is not used if the previous field for zone name is left blank.</p>
<h4 id="field-rated-capacity_2">Field: Rated Capacity</h4>
<p>This field defines the rated capacity of the transformer in VA.</p>
<h4 id="field-phase">Field: Phase</h4>
<p>This field indicates whether the transformer is a single phase or three phase type. The two alternative values are 1 or 3. The default is 3. This field is currently not used in the model.</p>
<h4 id="field-conductor-material">Field: Conductor Material</h4>
<p>This field specifies the winding material used by the transformer. There are two options: Copper and Aluminum. The choice will determine the thermal coefficient of resistance used to calculate the temperature correction factor for the transformer load losses. The default is Aluminum.</p>
<h4 id="field-full-load-temperature-rise">Field: Full Load Temperature Rise</h4>
<p>This numeric field defines the temperature rise of the windings above the ambient temperature, when the transformer is loaded at its nameplate rating. For liquid-immersed distribution transformers, the full load temperature rise usually takes the value of 65 °C. For dry-type transformers, the temperature rise usually takes three optional values: 80, 115 and 150 °C. This field accepts any value between the minimum (50 °C) and the maximum (180 °C). The default is 150 °C.</p>
<h4 id="field-fraction-of-eddy-current-losses">Field: Fraction of Eddy Current Losses</h4>
<p>This field defines the fraction of load losses resulting from the eddy currents. Transformer’s load losses comprise two parts: the ohmic loss due to the current flowing in the resistance of the windings and the eddy and stray losses due to the eddy currents. This field indicates the fraction of the load losses due to the eddy currents. This numeric field should have a value between 0.0 and 1.0. The default is 0.1.</p>
<h4 id="field-performance-input-method_1">Field: Performance Input Method</h4>
<p>This alpha field contains the method by which the user will specify the transformer performance: “RatedLosses” or “NominalEfficiency”. If this field is left blank in the input data file, the default input method is assumed to be “RatedLosses”. If the method “NominalEfficiency” is selected, the user must enter the fields for the nameplate efficiency and the corresponding reference coditions as described below. If the method “RatedLosses” is selected, then the fields for rated no load loss and load loss must be entered as described below.</p>
<h4 id="field-rated-no-load-loss">Field: Rated No Load Loss</h4>
<p>This field defines the no load loss (W) at rated load and conditions. The no load loss is roughly constant and exists whenever the transformer is energized. The no load loss is also called the core loss. This field is used only if the field of Performance Input Method is specified as “RatedLosses”.</p>
<h4 id="field-rated-load-loss">Field: Rated Load Loss</h4>
<p>This field defines the load loss (W) at rated load and conditions. The load loss varies with the square of the load being served by the transformer. The load loss is also called the winding loss because the load loss occurs in the primary and secondary windings around the core. This field is used only if the field of Performance Input Method is specified as “RatedLosses”.</p>
<h4 id="field-nameplate-efficiency">Field: Nameplate Efficiency</h4>
<p>This field contains the value for transformer efficiency at a given per unit load and specified reference temperature. This field is used only if the field of Performance Input Method is specified as “NominalEfficiency”. The default is 0.98.</p>
<h4 id="field-per-unit-load-for-nameplate-efficiency">Field: Per Unit Load for Nameplate Efficiency</h4>
<p>This field defines the percentage of the rated capacity at which the nameplate efficiency is measured. According to the NEMA (National Electrical Manufactures Association) Standard TP-1, the per unit load takes the value of 0.35 for dry-type distribution transformers and it takes the value of 0.50 for liquid-filled distribution transformers. The default is 0.35.</p>
<h4 id="field-reference-temperature-for-nameplate-efficiency">Field: Reference Temperature for Nameplate Efficiency</h4>
<p>This field defines the conductor temperature at which the nameplate efficiency is measured. This field is used only if the field of Performance Input Method is specified as “NominalEfficiency”. According to the NEMA Standard TP-1, the reference temperature takes the value of 75 °C for dry-type distribution transformers and it takes the value of 55 °C for liquid-filled distribution transformers. The default is 75 °C.</p>
<h4 id="field-per-unit-load-for-maximum-efficiency">Field: Per Unit Load for Maximum Efficiency</h4>
<p>This field defines the percentage of the rated capacity at which the maximum efficiency is obtained. This field is used only if the field of Performance Input Method is specified as “NominalEfficiency”. A blank field indicates that it takes the same value as the per unit load for nameplate efficiency.</p>
<h4 id="field-consider-transformer-loss-for-utility-cost">Field: Consider Transformer Loss for Utility Cost</h4>
<p>This field indicates whether the transformer losses are considered to calculate utility cost. In some cases, the transformer losses are required but they are not part of the energy consumption for utility cost calculation. For example, the transformer is owned by the utility company but it locates in the building. In this case, it might be desired to model transformer energy losses for HVAC operation but the energy losses will not be accounted for utility cost.</p>
<h4 id="field-electric-meter-1-10-name">Field: Electric Meter 1-10 Name</h4>
<p>A transformer may serve different loads such as plug loads, some lighting loads, and some HVAC equipment loads. The user needs to specify which loads are connected to the transformer. This is achieved by providing a list of electric meters wired to the transformer. The input object can currently accommodate up to ten meters, but it is extensible by modifying the Energy+.idd entry. Any valid electric meter name can be used here to wire to the transformer loads. Many different meters are automatically generated by the program and will depend on the objects used throughout the input file. The typical process of determining the exact name to enter in this field involves doing an initial run of EnergyPlus and then examining the *.mdd file which will list the meters and their resulting names. A custom meter is also supported. The meter must have electricity as its resource type.</p>

<p>This output is the total energy losses occurred in the transformer when it is used for input power from grid to building. It is set as zero if the transformer is used to transfer energy from onsite power generators to the electricity grid. This output is also added to a meter with ResourceType = Electricity, GroupKey = System.</p>
<h4 id="transformer-cogeneration-electric-loss-energy-j">Transformer Cogeneration Electric Loss Energy  [J]</h4>
<p>This output is the total energy losses occurred in the transformer when it is used for input onsite cogeneration to the grid. It is set as zero if the transformer is used to transfer the electricity grid to building. This output is also added to a meter with ResourceType = ElectricityProduced, EndUseKey = Cogeneration, GroupKey = System.</p>
<h3 id="electricloadcenterdistribution">ElectricLoadCenter:Distribution</h3>
<p>ElectricLoadCenter:Distribution objects are used to include on-site electricity generators in a simulation. The electric load center dispatches generators according to operation schemes and tracks and reports the amount of electricity generated and purchased. When using on-site generators, the program provides a “net” report where the total electricity used is reduced by the amount generated on site. Electrical demand tracking is done by the internal or custom meters used by EnergyPlus for reporting. The thermal demand tracking uses internal load calculations from the plant simulation. The dispatching of different generators is based on expectations based on their nominal/rated electric power output. If the current conditions are such that the generator model determines that generation was higher or lower, then the results of the dispatch may differ from expectations.</p>
<p>Multiple different ElectricLoadCenter:Distribution objects can be included in an input file.  A great deal of flexibility is available by mixing different load centers and operating schemes. If multiple load centers are used, the supervisory control will dispatch generators sequentially across the load centers.  Therefore, the order of these input objects in the IDF file becomes important with the generators associated with first load center in the file being the first to be managed.  A certain amount of caution is needed to avoid conflicting operating schemes.</p>
<p>The electricity produced from photovoltaic arrays will be reported in the electricity produced output variable and will reduce the demand that the generators will try to meet for that timestep.</p>
<h4 id="field-name_149">Field: Name</h4>
<p>This alpha field contains the identifying name for the electric load center.</p>
<h4 id="field-generator-list-name">Field: Generator List Name</h4>
<p>This alpha field contains the identifying name for the list of generators in the set.</p>
<h4 id="field-generator-operation-scheme-type">Field: Generator Operation Scheme Type</h4>
<p>This alpha field specifies the type of operating scheme for the generator set. The available operating schemes are “Baseload,” “DemandLimit,” “TrackElectrical,” “TrackSchedule,“ “TrackMeter,” “FollowThermal,” and “FollowThermalLimitElectrical.” The Baseload scheme operates the generators at their rated (requested) electric power output when the generator is scheduled ON (ref. ElectricLoadCenter:Generators). The Baseload scheme requests all generators scheduled ON (available) to operate, even if the amount of electric power generated exceeds the total facility electric power demand. The DemandLimit scheme limits the amount of purchased electrical from the utility to the amount specified in the input object. The DemandLimit scheme tries to have the generators meet all of the demand above the purchased electric limit set by the user in the next field. The TrackElectrical scheme tries to have the generators meet all of the electrical demand for the building. The TrackSchedule scheme tries to have the generators meet all of the electrical demand determined in a user-defined schedule. The TrackMeter scheme tries to have the generators meet all the electrical demand from a meter, which could also be a user-defined custom meter.</p>
<p>The DemandLimit, TrackElectrical, TrackSchedule, and TrackMeter schemes will sequentially load the available generators. All demand not met by available generator capacity will be met by purchased electrical. Therefore, if DemandLimit, TrackElectrical, TrackSchedule, or TrackMeter is utilized and the available generators are not enough to meet demand, then purchased electrical will offset the difference. If a generator is needed in the simulation for a small load and it is less than the minimum part load ratio the generator will operate at the minimum part load ratio and the excess will either reduce demand or the excess energy will be available for returning to the electric grid.</p>
<p>The FollowThermal and FollowThermalLimitElectrical schemes are for heat following cogeneration and run the generators to meet the thermal demand.  The FollowThermal schemes allow excess electrical generation to be exported to the grid, while the FollowThermalLimitElectrical scheme restricts generator output to a maximum of the building’s current electrical demand (so that no electricity is exported).  The thermal demand is determined from the plant modeling and depends on the flow requested by other components on the demand side of the plant loop, the loop temperatures, and the loop temperature set point.  The electric load center converts the thermal load to an electrical load using a nominal ratio of the thermal to electrical power production for each generator.  For these schemes, the generator needs to be connected to the supply side of a plant loop and  components that request hot water need to be on the demand side of the plant loop.  This is different than the usual configuration for electrical following schemes where the generator is put on the demand side and request flow for the purposes of cooling the generator.  Therefore a switch from one of the electrical-based operating schemes to one of the thermal-based operating schemes requires a substantial change in plant topology.</p>
<p>If the load center includes electrical storage, then the choice of operating schemes will also affect how storage is managed.</p>
<h4 id="field-demand-limit-scheme-purchased-electric-demand-limit">Field: Demand Limit Scheme Purchased Electric Demand Limit</h4>
<p>This numerical field is the user input for the demand limit above which the generators will try and meet the entire electrical load on the building minus the photovoltaic array if available.</p>
<h4 id="field-track-schedule-name-scheme-schedule-name">Field: Track Schedule Name Scheme Schedule Name</h4>
<p>This alpha field is the user input for the name of a schedule defined elsewhere in the input file that contains values for the “demand” loads placed on the generator(s). The schedule values should be in Watts.</p>
<h4 id="field-track-meter-scheme-meter-name">Field: Track Meter Scheme Meter Name</h4>
<p>This alpha field is the user input for the name of a meter. Any valid meter name can be used here to control the loads that the generator(s) will try to meet. Many different meters are automatically generated by the program and will depend on the objects used throughout the input file. The typical process of determining the exact name to enter in this field involves doing an initial run of EnergyPlus and then examining the *.rdd file which will list the meters and their resulting names. The *.mtd file will also be useful to understand what exactly is included in a meter. The user can also use the Output:CustomMeter objects to redefine meter names and to control what electrical loads are included on them in a flexible manner.</p>
<h4 id="field-electrical-buss-type">Field: Electrical Buss Type</h4>
<p>This alpha field is used to describe how the electric load center is configured with respect to any power conditioning and/or storage equipment. There are five configurations for load centers available by using one of these keywords:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>AlternatingCurrent</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AlternatingCurrentWithStorage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DirectCurrentWithInverter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DirectCurrentWithInverterDCStorage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DirectCurrentWithInverterACStorage</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>AlternatingCurrent is the default.  All the generators connected to a specific load center need to be of the same type (all AC or all DC).  If the generators are DC, then an inverter is needed to convert the DC to AC.  If there are DC generators and a DC electrical storage device on the buss along with an inverter, then use DirectCurrentWithInverterDCStorage in this field.  See the Engineering Reference for more information including diagrams of the load center configurations.</p>
<h4 id="field-inverter-object-name">Field: Inverter Object Name</h4>
<p>This field is used to identify the inverter connected to this load center (if any).  This field is only used if the Electrical Buss Type is set to DirectCurrentWithInverter and should contain the user-defined name of an inverter object.  There are three types of inverter models available—see ElectricLoadCenter:Inverter:Simple, ElectricLoadCenter:Inverter:LookUpTable,  or ElectricLoadCenter:Inverter:FunctionOfPower.  Enter the name of one of these types of inverter objects defined elsewhere in the input file.</p>
<h4 id="field-electrical-storage-object-name">Field: Electrical Storage Object Name</h4>
<p>This field is used to identify the electrical storage connected to this load center (if any).  This field is only used if the Electrical Buss Type is set to DirectCurrentWithInverterDCStorage or DirectCurrentWithInverterACStorage.  Enter the name of an ElectricLoadCenter:Storage:Simple object defined elsewhere in the input file.</p>
<h4 id="field-transformer-object-name">Field: Transformer Object Name</h4>
<p>This field is used to identify the transformer connected to this load center (if any). This field can be used for any electrical buss types. Enter the name of an ElectricLoadCenter:Transformer object defined elsewhere in the input file.</p>

<h3 id="electricloadcenterdistribution-outputs">ElectricLoadCenter:Distribution Outputs</h3>
<p>There are three levels of results reporting related to electric load centers and generators.  The top level of reporting provides results across the whole building and all the different electric load centers and generators.  The second level of reporting provides results for individual load centers.  The third level is for each type of generator (see individual generator descriptions).  This section discusses the first two levels.</p>
<p>The whole-building summary output variables are:</p>
<p>HVAC,Average,Facility Total Produced Electric Power [W]</p>
<p>HVAC,Sum,Facility Total Produced Electric Energy [J]</p>
<p>HVAC,Average,Facility Total Purchased Electric Power [W]</p>
<p>HVAC,Sum,Facility Total Purchased Electric Energy [J]</p>
<p>HVAC,Average,Facility Total Building Electric Demand Power [W]</p>
<p>HVAC,Average,Facility Total HVAC Electric Demand Power [W]</p>
<p>HVAC,Average,Facility Total Electric Demand Power [W]</p>
<p>These output variables all use a default keyword “Whole Building.”</p>
<p>These output variables can also be accessed without specifying generation equipment by including the syntax shown below:</p>
<p>ElectricLoadCenter:Distribution,</p>
<p>Electric Load Center; !- Name</p>
<p>Even if no ElectricLoadCenter:Distribution object is included, these output variables are also available for all simulations that have any electricity consuming equipment with the default keyword name “Electrical Service.”</p>
<h4 id="facility-total-produced-electric-power-w">Facility Total Produced Electric Power [W]</h4>
<h4 id="facility-total-produced-electric-energy-j">Facility Total Produced Electric Energy [J]</h4>
<p>These outputs are the total generator and photovoltaic electricity produced on-site for the entire model, and they are in both Power and Energy units.  When electrical storage is used with on-site production, the electricity put into storage is decremented from production and the electricity removed storage is added to production.  This means that losses from a round trip through electrical storage decrease on-site electricity production.</p>
<h4 id="facility-total-purchased-electric-power-w">Facility Total Purchased Electric Power [W]</h4>
<h4 id="facility-total-purchased-electric-energy-j">Facility Total Purchased Electric Energy [J]</h4>
<p>These outputs are the total of electricity purchased for the entire model in both Power and Energy units. This value is always positive and indicates the amount of energy is purchased from the utility.</p>
<h4 id="facility-total-surplus-electric-energy-j">Facility Total Surplus Electric Energy [J]</h4>
<p>This output is the excess electricity produced and sent out to the electrical grid. This value is always positive and indicates the surplus electricity from generation that exceeds whole-building demand and fed into the grid.</p>
<h4 id="facility-total-building-electric-demand-power-w">Facility Total Building Electric Demand Power [W]</h4>
<p>This output variable includes all of the electric demand from the building (non-HVAC) portion of the simulation, which would contain lights, electrical equipment, exterior lights and equipment, etc.</p>
<h4 id="facility-total-hvac-electric-demand-power-w">Facility Total HVAC Electric Demand Power [W]</h4>
<p>This output variable includes all of the electric demand from the HVAC portion of the simulation, which would contain fans, electric coils, pumps, chillers, cooling towers, etc.</p>
<h4 id="facility-total-electric-demand-power-w">Facility Total Electric Demand Power [W]</h4>
<p>This is the total of the whole Building and HVAC electric demands.</p>
<h4 id="facility-net-purchased-electric-power-w">Facility Net Purchased Electric Power [W]</h4>
<h4 id="facility-net-purchased-electric-energy-j">Facility Net Purchased Electric Energy [J]</h4>
<p>These outputs are the net electricity purchased in both Power and Energy units. This value can be either positive or negative. Positive values are defined as electricity purchased from the utility. Negative values are defined as surplus electricity fed back into the grid.</p>
<p>Each ElectricLoadCenter also collects results from the individual generators that are connected to that load center.  The output variables available at the ElectricLoadCenter level are:</p>
<p>HVAC,Average,Electric Load Center Requested Electric Power [W]</p>
<p>HVAC,Average,Electric Load Center Produced Electric Power [W]</p>
<p>HVAC,Sum,Electric Load Center Produced Electric Energy [J]</p>
<p>HVAC,Average,Electric Load Center Produced Thermal Rate [W]</p>
<p>HVAC,Sum,Electric Load Center Produced Thermal Energy [J]</p>
<h4 id="electric-load-center-requested-electric-power-w">Electric Load Center Requested Electric Power [W]</h4>
<p>This output variable is the average electric power supply (in watts) requested by the load center from its generators for the time step being reported. For the baseload operating scheme, this output variable should equal the sum of the power supply requests for the ‘available’ generators associated with this load center (ref. ElectricLoadCenter:Generators). In other cases, this output could be different from the sum of the power supply requests for the generators associated with this load center. For example, a generator might be requested to provide a certain amount of power but can only provide a fraction of the requested amount. In this case the load center will detect this shortfall and include it when calculating the power request for the next available generator. Therefore, the sum of the power supply requests for the individual generators associated with this load center (ref. ElectricLoadCenter:Generators) could be greater than the Electric Load Center Requested Electric Power output variable.</p>
<h4 id="electric-load-center-produced-electric-power-w">Electric Load Center Produced Electric Power [W]</h4>
<h4 id="electric-load-center-produced-electric-energy-j">Electric Load Center Produced Electric Energy [J]</h4>
<p>These outputs are the sum of electrical energy and power produced by the generators attached to a particular load center.  The keywords for these reports are the unique names of ElectricLoadCenter:Distribution objects.</p>
<h4 id="electric-load-center-produced-thermal-rate-w">Electric Load Center Produced Thermal Rate [W]</h4>
<h4 id="electric-load-center-produced-thermal-energy-j">Electric Load Center Produced Thermal Energy [J]</h4>
<p>These outputs are the sum of the thermal energy and power produced by the generators attached to a particular load center.  The keywords for these reports are the unique names of ElectricLoadCenter:Distribution objects.</p>
<h3 id="electricloadcentergenerators">ElectricLoadCenter:Generators</h3>
<p>The ElectricLoadCenter:Generators object is used to provide a list of the generators to include in the simulation. The list includes the names and types of all the generators along with separate availability schedules, the rated power output, and thermal-to-electrical power ratio for each. Sets of five input fields are repeated for each generator. If more than 30 generators are needed, EnergyPlus will “auto-extend” to suit the needs but other interfaces (such as the IDF Editor may not). The user can always modify the Energy+.idd file to accommodate the extra fields necessary, but it is likely the next release of EnergyPlus will overwrite any user modifications.</p>
<h4 id="field-name_150">Field: Name</h4>
<p>This alpha field contains the identifying name for the generators in the set.</p>
<h4 id="fieldset-name-object-type-rated-power-output-availability-thermal-ratio-up-to-30">FieldSet: Name, Object Type, Rated Power Output, Availability, Thermal Ratio up to 30</h4>
<p>Each generator is specified by a set of 5 input fields that contain an identifying name, a keyword that indicates the type of generator, the rated output of the generator, the availability schedule of the generator, and the thermal to electrical power production ratio.</p>
<h4 id="field-generator-x-name">Field: Generator &lt;x&gt; Name</h4>
<p>This alpha field contains the identifying name for the first generator in the list.</p>
<h4 id="field-generator-x-object-type">Field: Generator &lt;x&gt; Object Type</h4>

</ul>
<p>These keywords are the names of the input objects for the type of generator.</p>
<h4 id="field-generator-x-rated-electric-power-output">Field: Generator &lt;x&gt; Rated Electric Power Output</h4>
<p>This numeric field contains the nominal electric power output to be requested from generator 1. It is normally equal to the rated power output of the generator in Watts. This value is used only for supervisory control and generator dispatch; the actual power output for each time step is determined by the generator models. This value affects how much a generator is loaded (i.e., requested electric power output) and can also impact the operation of an electric storage unit (e.g., LoadCenter:Storage:Simple) if one is connected to the associated load distribution center (ref. ElectricLoadCenter:Distribution). Refer to Electrical Storage in the EnergyPlus Engineering Reference for more details regarding this input field and its relationship with electric storage.</p>
<h4 id="field-generator-x-availability-schedule-name">Field: Generator &lt;x&gt; Availability Schedule Name</h4>
<p>This alpha field is used as an identifying field for the generator availability schedule. If not blank, this field must contain the name of a schedule defined elsewhere in the input file.  A schedule value of &lt;=0.0 indicates the generator is not available, while a schedule value &gt; 0.0 indicates that the generator is available to operate. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.</p>
<h4 id="field-generator-x-rated-thermal-to-electrical-power-ratio">Field: Generator &lt;x&gt; Rated Thermal to Electrical Power Ratio</h4>
<p>This numeric field contains the ratio of the rated thermal output to the rated electric output.  It is only needed and used if the operation scheme is set to <strong>FollowThermal</strong> or <strong>FollowThermalLimitElectrical</strong>.  This nominal ratio is only used for control and dispatch decisions.  This value should be generally consistent with the more detailed performance input for the individual generator component models but it is not used in those component models.</p>

<h3 id="electricloadcentergenerators-outputs">ElectricLoadCenter:Generators Outputs</h3>
<p>A single output variable is available for each generator specified via this object as described below:</p>
<p>HVAC,Average,Generator Requested Electric Power [W]</p>
<h4 id="generator-requested-electric-power-w">Generator Requested Electric Power [W]</h4>
<p>This output variable represents the average electric power supply in Watts that is being requested from a specific generator for the time step being reported. In some instances the output value may be the Rated Electric Power Output specified for the generator in the ElectricLoadCenter:Generators object. If the generator is not available for a simulation time step (as indicated by its availability schedule), then the power supply request will be zero. The power supply request may be less than the rated electric power output if the overall electric power reduction target has already been met, partially or completely, by electric power produced by other generators. If an EnergyPlus Energy Management System is used to specify an electric power supply request for this generator, then that EMS request will be reflected in this output variable.</p>
<h3 id="electricloadcenterinvertersimple">ElectricLoadCenter:Inverter:Simple</h3>
<p>This input object is used to model conversion from Direct Current (DC) to Alternating Current (AC) in an electric load center that contains photovoltaic modules.  Such a load center has an array of photovoltaic modules that feed an inverter DC power and the inverter produces AC power.  This input object is for the simplest inverter model and uses a fixed efficiency.  There are two other types of inverters with more complex models described below.</p>
<h4 id="field-name_151">Field: Name</h4>
<p>This field contains a unique name for the inverter.  The name entered must also be unique across all other types of inverters that may also be in the input file.</p>
<h4 id="field-availability-schedule-name_35">Field: Availability Schedule Name</h4>
<p>This field contains the name of a schedule that describes when the inverter is available.  If the inverter is scheduled to not be available, by scheduling a value of 0, then it cannot produce AC power and will not consume ancillary power during standby.  Any non-zero schedule value means the inverter is available to produce AC power and consume ancillary power during standby.  If the Inverter is scheduled to be unavailable but it is being supplied with DC power anyway, then the energy is dissipated as heat. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.</p>
<h4 id="field-zone-name_9">Field: Zone Name</h4>
<p>This field contains the name of the thermal zone where the inverter is located.  Entering a valid name of zone here will direct EnergyPlus to include the inverter’s losses as heat gains to the named thermal zone.  If the inverter is not within a thermal zone, then this field can be left blank (and the thermal energy associated with inverter losses is removed from the building model).</p>
<h4 id="field-radiative-fraction_1">Field: Radiative Fraction</h4>
<p>This field contains the fraction of inverter thermal losses that enter the zone as long-wave thermal radiation.  This should be a factor between 0.0 and 1.0.  The balance of the losses is convective.  This field is not used if the previous field for zone name is left blank.</p>
<h4 id="field-inverter-efficiency">Field: Inverter Efficiency</h4>
<p>This field contains the value for inverter efficiency.  In the simple model, efficiency is a constant.  This is the so-called 1-term model.  Input data for different types of inverters is available at http://www.gosolarcalifornia.org/equipment/inverter_tests/summaries where the “CEC Efficiency” would be the value to enter here.</p>

<p>This input object is used to model conversion from Direct Current (DC) to Alternating Current (AC) in an electric load center that contains photovoltaic modules.  Such a load center has an array of photovoltaic modules that feed an inverter DC power and the inverter produces AC power.  This input object is for an inverter model where efficiency is a function of normalized power.</p>
<h4 id="field-name_152">Field: Name</h4>
<p>This field contains a unique name for the inverter.  The name entered must also be unique across all other types of inverters that may also be in the input file.</p>
<h4 id="field-availability-schedule-name_36">Field: Availability Schedule Name</h4>
<p>This field contains the name of a schedule that describes when the inverter is available.  If the inverter is scheduled to not be available, by scheduling a value of 0, then it cannot produce AC power, nor contribute heat gains to the zone, and will not consume ancillary power during standby.  Any non-zero schedule value means the inverter is available to produce AC power, contribute heat gains to the zone and consume ancillary power during standby. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.</p>
<h4 id="field-zone-name_10">Field: Zone Name</h4>
<p>This field contains the name of the thermal zone where the inverter is located.  Entering a valid name of zone here will direct EnergyPlus to include the inverter’s losses as heat gains to the named thermal zone.  If the inverter is not within a thermal zone, then this field can be left blank (and the thermal energy associated with inverter losses is removed from the building model).</p>
<h4 id="field-radiative-fraction_2">Field: Radiative Fraction</h4>
<p>This field contains the fraction of inverter thermal losses that enter the zone as long-wave thermal radiation.  This should be a factor between 0.0 and 1.0.  The balance of the losses is convective.  This field is not used if the previous field for zone name is left blank.</p>

<h4 id="field-maximum-power">Field: Maximum Power</h4>
<p>This field contains an upper limit on the AC power produced by the inverter.  If the resulting power output would be above this level, then the power produced is capped at this level with the rest of input power converted to losses (unless it is going into storage).</p>

<h3 id="electricloadcenterstorage-battery">ElectricLoadCenter:Storage: Battery</h3>
<p>This object uses the kinetic battery model (KiBaM) to simulate rechargeable battery banks in an electrical load center. The battery bank is a collection of one or more individual battery modules. Given the surplus or deficit power from the electrical system and the state of charge from the previous time step, this object can model the voltage, current, and energy losses with charging and discharging during each time step. The cumulative battery damage can be also modeled and reported at the end of each simulation run.</p>
<p>This object allows the simulation of both lead-acid and Nickel Cadmium batteries. With input parameters derived from specific battery tests, the object is expected to support other battery types such as Lithium-ion batteries.</p>
<p>The kinetic battery model assumes that part of the battery’s energy storage capacity is immediately available in discharging or charging while the rest is chemically bound. As a function of constant current, the battery capacity is related to three parameters: the maximum capacity at infinitesimal current, the capacity ratio of available charges, and the conversion ratio between available charges and bound charges. These parameters are usually obtained via curve fitting based on battery data sheets or test data.</p>
<p>Each individual battery module is modeled as a voltage source in series with an electrical resistance.  KiBaM assumes that the internal resistance is constant and the open circuit voltage varies with the electric current, the state of charge and the operation mode (charging or discharging). For an individual battery module, the open circuit voltage at any time is correlated to the voltage at fully charged/discharged state and three other regression coefficients.  These regression coefficients are usually obtained via curve fitting based on battery test data.</p>
<p>The object offers user the option to perform battery life calculation. If battery life is modeled, the user needs to provide a group of coefficients for the correlation between the number of cycles for battery failure and the corresponding cycle range.

<h4 id="field-heat-recovery-maximum-temperature">Field: Heat Recovery Maximum Temperature</h4>
<p>This field sets the maximum temperature that this piece of equipment can produce for heat recovery. The idea behind this field is that the current models do not take temperatures into account for availability and they just pass Q's around the loop without a temperature limit. This temperature limit puts an upper bound on the recovered heat and limits the max temperatures leaving the component.</p>
<p>As temperatures in the loop approach the maximum temperature, the temperature difference between the entering water and the surfaces in the piece of equipment becomes smaller. For the given heat recovery flow rate and that temperature difference the amount of heat recovered will be reduced, and eventually there will be no heat recovered when the entering water temperature is equal to the maximum temperature specified by the user in this field. The reduced amount of heat recovered will diminish if the temperature of the loop approach is the maximum temperature, and this will show up in the reporting. This allows the user to set the availability or the quality of the heat recovered for usage in other parts of the system or to heat domestic hot water supply.</p>
<p>The temperature is specified in degrees C.</p>

<h4 id="field-heat-recovery-lube-energy-curve-name">Field: Heat Recovery Lube Energy Curve Name</h4>
<p>This alpha field contains the name of the Recovery Lube Heat curve. The curve itself is specified separately using a curve object (see Curve:Quadlinear object). The Recovery Lubricant Heat Curve is a quadratic equation that determines the ratio of recovery lube heat to fuel energy. Used to calculate the recoverable lube oil heat as a function of part-load ratio. The defining equation is:</p>
<div>\[RecoveryLubeHeatToFuelRatio = {C_1} + {C_2}RL + {C_3}R{L^2}\]</div>

<p>where RL is the Ratio of Load to Rated Power Output.</p>
<h4 id="u-factor-times-area-ua-curve_1">U-Factor Times Area (UA) Curve</h4>
<p>The UA curve applies to the exhaust gas heat exchanger. The curve is an equation that determines the overall heat transfer coefficient for the exhaust gases with the stack. The heat transfer coefficient ultimately helps determine the exhaust stack temperature. The defining equation is:</p>
<div>\[UAToCapacityRatio = {C_1}GeneratorRatedPowerOutpu{t^{{C_2}}}\]</div>

<p>The following two fields contain the coefficients for the equation.</p>
<h4 id="field-coefficient-1-of-u-factor-times-area-curve_1">Field: Coefficient 1 of U-Factor Times Area Curve</h4>
<p>This numeric field contains the first coefficient for the overall heat transfer coefficient curve.</p>
<h4 id="field-coefficient-2-of-u-factor-times-area-curve_1">Field: Coefficient 2 of U-Factor Times Area Curve</h4>
<p>This numeric field contains the second (exponential) coefficient for the overall heat transfer coefficient curve.</p>
<h4 id="field-maximum-exhaust-flow-per-unit-of-power-output_1">Field: Maximum Exhaust Flow per Unit of Power Output</h4>

<p>This alpha field contains the identifying name for the combustion turbine generator heat recovery side inlet node.</p>
<h4 id="field-heat-recovery-outlet-node-name_1">Field: Heat Recovery Outlet Node Name</h4>
<p>This alpha field contains the identifying name for the combustion turbine generator heat recovery side outlet node.</p>
<h4 id="field-fuel-type_3">Field: Fuel Type</h4>
<p>This alpha field determines the type of fuel that the generator uses. Valid choices are: <strong>NaturalGas, PropaneGas, Diesel, Gasoline, FuelOil#1, FuelOil#2, OtherFuel1</strong> and <strong>OtherFuel2</strong>. The default is <strong>NaturalGas</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="field-heat-recovery-maximum-temperature_1">Field: Heat Recovery Maximum Temperature</h4>
<p>This field sets the maximum temperature that this piece of equipment can produce for heat recovery. The idea behind this field is that the current models do not take temperatures into account for availability and they just pass Q's around the loop without a temperature limit. This temperature limit puts an upper bound on the recovered heat and limits the max temperatures leaving the component.</p>
<p>As temperatures in the loop approach the maximum temperature, the temperature difference between the entering water and the surfaces in the piece of equipment becomes smaller. For the given heat recovery flow rate and that temperature difference the amount of heat recovered will be reduced, and eventually there will be no heat recovered when the entering water temperature is equal to the maximum temperature specified by the user in this field. The reduced amount of heat recovered will diminish if the temperature of the loop approach is the maximum temperature, and this will show up in the reporting. This allows the user to set the availability or the quality of the heat recovered for usage in other parts of the system or to heat domestic hot water supply.</p>
<p>The temperature is specified in degrees C.</p>
<h4 id="field-outdoor-air-inlet-node-name">Field: Outdoor Air Inlet Node Name</h4>
<p>This field is optional. It is used to explicitly define an outdoor air node for the inlet for combustion air stream. Defining an outdoor air node here allows using the height-dependent model for outdoor air conditions.</p>

<p>This alpha field specifies the name of a quadratic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of heat recovery to water (thermal power output) as a function of the inlet water temperature. The output of this curve is multiplied by the steady-state heat recovery at the current combustion inlet air temperature and elevation to give the heat recovery rate (thermal power output) at non-reference inlet water conditions. This curve should be normalized to have a value of 1.0 at the Reference Inlet Water Temperature, and the curve should be valid for the range of inlet water temperatures anticipated for the simulation period.

<p>This numeric field specifies the minimum (volumetric) water flow rate through the heat recovery heat exchanger in cubic meters per second. The minimum input value is 0.0, and a value of 0.0 is assumed if this field is left blank.</p>
<h4 id="field-maximum-heat-recovery-water-flow-rate">Field: Maximum Heat Recovery Water Flow Rate</h4>
<p>This numeric field specifies the maximum (volumetric) water flow rate through the heat recovery heat exchanger in cubic meters per second. The minimum input value for this field is 0.0, and a value of 0.0 is assumed if this field is left blank. The maximum heat recovery water flow rate must be greater than or equal to the minimum heat recovery water flow rate.</p>
<h4 id="field-maximum-heat-recovery-water-temperature">Field: Maximum Heat Recovery Water Temperature</h4>

<p>This field describes the value for the coefficient used to determine the rate of fuel flow during warm up. The coefficient, <em>k<sub>f</sub></em>, is used in the following relation,</p>
<div>\[{\dot m_{fuel,warm - up}} = {\dot m_{fuel,ss - \max }} + {k_f}{\dot m_{fuel,ss - \max }}\left( {\frac{{{T_{eng,nom}} - {T_{room}}}}{{{T_{eng}} - {T_{room}}}}} \right)\]</div>

<h4 id="field-nominal-engine-operating-temperature">Field: Nominal Engine Operating Temperature</h4>
<p>This field describes the nominal engine temperature during normal, steady-state operation, <span>${T_{eng,nom}}$</span> [°C].</p>
<h4 id="field-warm-up-power-coefficient">Field: Warm Up Power Coefficient</h4>
<p>This field describes the value for the coefficient used to determine the rate of power production during warm up. The coefficient k<sub>p</sub> is used in the following relation,</p>
<div>\[{P_{net,warm - up}} = {P_{\max }}{k_p}\left( {\frac{{{T_{eng}} - {T_{room}}}}{{{T_{eng,nom}} - {T_{room}}}}} \right)\]</div>

<h4 id="field-warm-up-fuel-flow-rate-limit-ratio">Field: Warm Up Fuel Flow Rate Limit Ratio</h4>
<p>This field is used to describe a limit to the fuel flow rate during warm up. The limit is a ratio multiplied by the maximum fuel flow rate during normal operation (corresponding to the fuel flow for maximum electrical power). If the warm up operating fuel flow rate is twice the steady state fuel flow at maximum power, then a value of 2.0 would be entered in this field. This field is only used with the nominal engine temperature warm up mode and is intended for Stirling engines.</p>
<h4 id="field-warm-up-delay-time">Field: Warm Up Delay Time</h4>
<p>This field is used to model the warm up operation when the warm up mode is “TimeDelay.”</p>
<p>Enter the time between activation and power generation in seconds.</p>
<h4 id="field-cool-down-power">Field: Cool Down Power</h4>
<p>This field describes the power used by the CHP unit’s ancillary systems while in cool down operation mode. Cool down operation mode occurs whenever the unit has recently been told to stop producing power.  Power here is consumed and entered as a positive value that indicates negative generation. For example, a component such as a cooling fan might continue to run during cool down.</p>
<h4 id="field-cool-down-delay-time">Field: Cool Down Delay Time</h4>
<p>This field is used to describe the time it takes for the CHP unit to cool off and complete the cool down operation. Enter the time between deactivation and the end of a cool down period in seconds.</p>
<h4 id="field-restart-mode">Field: Restart Mode</h4>
<p>This field is used to choose between two different control situations for the cool down operation. The two options for this field are “MandatoryCoolDown” and “OptionalCoolDown.”   The former is used to direct the model to complete the entire cool down period before the generator can subsequently enter warm up mode. The latter directs the model to allow immediately switching to warm up mode, if power is requested before the cool down period is completed.</p>

<h3 id="generatorfuelcell">Generator:FuelCell</h3>
<p>This object is used to model small Fuel Cell (FC) generators. IEA/ECBCS Annex 42 – see www.cogen-sim.net, developed the FC model implemented in EnergyPlus. The model can be used for two general types of fuel cells, solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) and proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC). Warning! This is a complicated model, intended primarily for research. Because fuel cells for cogeneration (producing both heat and electricity) are not yet a mature product for building systems, the input data for this model are extremely difficult to obtain. However, the model is designed to allow investigating the relative implications of a broad array of subsystems and interactions with the building.</p>
<p>There should be one Generator:FuelCell object for each individual FC generator in the model. Multiple fuel cell generators can be included in a given simulation. Because there are a large number of inputs to the FC model and numerous, somewhat separable subsystems within a fuel cell, the EnergyPlus input objects have been organized into a number of separate input objects. This object simply refers to the names of all the other input objects that provide the input details for individual subsystems within the fuel cell cogeneration device. The following figure diagrams these separate subsystems. (not shown is an optional stack cooler with separate connections to heat recovery water loop and surrounding zone air).</p>
<p><img alt="SOFCSchematic" src="../../InputOutputReference/media/image467.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 152. Fuel cell subsystems.</p>
<p>Note that the FC model is formulated using the Lower Heating Value (LHV) of the fuel, whereas most other parts of EnergyPlus use the Higher Heating Value (HHV). LHV has important advantages over HHV in the context of the quality of heat recovered. While model coefficients for input performance descriptions are to be based on LHV, energy consumption and tariff calculations are also reported on HHV basis when using this model.</p>

If the model has multiple FC generators that are of the exact same type, then only one of these objects is needed and all the Generator:FuelCell can reference it. The model uses a number of curves to describe operating performance. Input data for specific models of FC are not yet available but will be produced by IEA Annex 42 and should be available in the future.</p>

<h4 id="field-efficiency-curve-mode">Field: Efficiency Curve Mode</h4>
<p>This field is used to choose between different modes of inputting the electrical efficiency curve. There are two options available for this Field: “Annex42” and “Normalized”. The “Annex42” option indicates that the efficiency curves are not normalized and are used for the single size and type of FC product. The “Normalized” option indicates that the efficiency curves are normalized (as is standard practice in EnergyPlus) relative to a single rating point. In the Annex42 mode, the curves directly represent efficiency as a function of fuel use, but in the Normalized mode, the curves represent an efficiency modification that is applied to the efficiency at the rating point.</p>
<h4 id="field-efficiency-curve-name">Field: Efficiency Curve Name</h4>
<p>This field contains the name of a Curve:Quadratic input object described elsewhere in the input file. The curve is a function of the net DC electric power, <span>${P_{el}}$</span> (W), produced by the power module and describes either the electrical efficiency or the how the efficiency is modified depending on the mode selected in the previous field. This quadratic curve is just one part of the entire parametric relation used to describe electrical efficiency <span>${\varepsilon_{el}}$</span>. For the Annex42 mode the full relation for efficiency is,</p>

<p>where the Curve:Quadratic input object named in this field serves to define the quadratic portion in the first set of brackets. For the Normalized mode the full relation for efficiency is,</p>
<div>\[{\varepsilon_{el}} = \left[ {{\varepsilon_0} + {\varepsilon_1} \cdot \frac{{{P_{el}}}}{{{P_{nom}}}} + {\varepsilon_2} \cdot {{\left( {\frac{{{P_{el}}}}{{{P_{nom}}}}} \right)}^2}} \right] \cdot {\varepsilon_{nom}} \cdot \left[ {1 - {N_{stops}} \cdot D} \right] \cdot \left[ {1 - (MAX(\int\limits_0 {dt - {t_{threshold}},0.0))}  \cdot L} \right]\]</div>

<h4 id="field-cycling-performance-degradation-coefficient">Field: Cycling Performance Degradation Coefficient</h4>

<h4 id="field-air-supply-rate-calculation-mode">Field: Air Supply Rate Calculation Mode</h4>
<p>This field describes how the model will calculate the air supply rate. There are three options to choose from:  “AirRatiobyStoics”, “QuadraticFunctionofElectricPower”, and “QuadraticFunctionofFuelRate.”  The choice will determine how the model calculates the rate of air and will depend on the formulations used to develop model input data. The choices are described in the next four fields.</p>
<h4 id="field-stoichiometric-ratio">Field: Stoichiometric Ratio</h4>
<p>This field describes the excess air ratio beyond stoichiometric air supply. This field is only used if the air supply rate calculation mode is AirRatiobyStoics. The total air supply ratio will be the value entered here plus 1.0. Thus if 1.0 is entered in this field, the total air flow will be 2.0 times what is needed to exactly match stoichiometry with the fuel supply.</p>
<h4 id="field-air-rate-function-of-electric-power-curve-name">Field: Air Rate Function of Electric Power Curve Name</h4>
<p>This field contains the name of a QuadraticCurve input object described elsewhere in the input file. This field is only used if the air supply rate calculation mode is QuadraticFunctionofElectricPower. The quadratic curve named here describes the first part of the relation below used to calculate the rate of inlet air, <span>${\dot N_{air}}$</span>(kmol/s). It is a quadratic function of the net DC electrical power, <span>${P_{el}}$</span> (W).</p>

<p>This field contains the name of a Curve:Quadratic input object described elsewhere in the input file. This field is only used if the air supply rate calculation mode is QuadraticFunctionofFuelRate.

<h4 id="field-air-intake-heat-recovery-mode">Field: Air Intake Heat Recovery Mode</h4>
<p>This field is used to control how heat losses from three other subsystems within the FC may or may not be recovered by the air inlet. There are six possible choices for what to use in this Field: “NoRecovery” “RecoverBurnerInverterStorage” “RecoverAuxiliaryBurner” “RecoverInverterandStorage” “RecoverInverter” and “RecoverElectricalStorage”.  If heat is recovered then that means that energy “losses” from those subsystems are added to the inlet air and fed back into the FC power module. The following table clarifies the meaning of the six possible choices.</p>

<p>The remaining fields in this object are repeating pairs of fields with one pair for each constituent and the same number as described in the previous field. The pairs consist of the name of the constituent followed by the molar fraction of that constituent.</p>
<h4 id="field-constituent-1-5-name">Field: Constituent 1-5 Name</h4>
<p>These fields describe the air stream constituents by name. The name field for each pair must be filled with one of these choices:  “CarbonDioxide”, “Nitrogen,” “Oxygen,” “Water,” or “Argon.”</p>

<h4 id="field-water-temperature-modeling-mode">Field: Water Temperature Modeling Mode</h4>
<p>This field describes how the model will determine the inlet temperature of the water stream. There are four options to choose from:  “TemperatureFromAirNode,” “TemperatureFromWaterNode,” “TemperatureFromSchedule,” and “MainsWaterTemperature.”  For the first two options, the temperature of the water inlet is determined by the temperature at the node named in the next field.

<h3 id="generatorfuelcellauxiliaryheater">Generator:FuelCell:AuxiliaryHeater</h3>
<p>This object is intended for modeling an auxiliary heater, however this portion of the model is not yet available in EnergyPlus. An auxiliary heater may be present in fuel cell products so that the unit can meet much higher thermal loads than would be possible using only cogeneration. This portion of the model will be added in the future once suitable cogeneration control capabilities are also available. The input fields are described for future reference but may change. The program still requires one of these objects be included even though the data are not yet used (so that internal data structures can be allocated).</p>
<h4 id="field-name_166">Field: Name</h4>
<p>This field contains a unique name for the fuel cell auxiliary heater subsystem.</p>
<h4 id="field-excess-air-ratio">Field: Excess Air Ratio</h4>
<p>This field describes the excess air ratio beyond stoichiometric air supply for the heater. The total air supply ratio will be the value entered here plus 1.0. Thus if 1.0 is entered in this field, the total air flow will be 2.0 times what is needed to exactly match stoichiometry with the fuel supply.</p>
<h4 id="field-ancillary-power-constant-term">Field: Ancillary Power Constant Term</h4>

<h4 id="field-ancillary-power-linear-term">Field: Ancillary Power Linear Term</h4>
<p>This field describes the linear term, <span>${x_1}$</span>, used to model the auxiliary burner’s ancillary devices.</p>
<h4 id="field-skin-loss-u-factor-times-area-value_1">Field: Skin Loss U-Factor Times Area Value</h4>
<p>This field describes the “UA” term (W/K) for calculating skin losses in the auxiliary burner. “UA” is the product of the overall heat transfer coefficient “U” and the area “A.”  The skin heat losses are calculated using,</p>
<div>\[{q_{aux - skin - losses}} = {(UA)_{aux}} \cdot ({T_{aux - mix}} - {T_{room}})\]</div>

<p>where, <span>${T_{aux - mix}}$</span> is temperature of product gases leaving the auxiliary burner and includes the mixing of the product gases from the fuel cell power module. Thus, the input for UA should reflect this choice of reference temperature rather than an exterior surface temperature of the auxiliary burner.</p>
<h4 id="field-skin-loss-destination">Field: Skin Loss Destination</h4>
<p>This field describes the user’s choice for what happens to the skin losses. There are two options:  “SurroundingZone” and “AirInletForFuelCell”. Entering SurroundingZone will direct the model to put the “lost” energy into the surrounding thermal Zone named in the next field. Entering AirInletForFuelCell will direct the model to put the “lost” energy into the air inlet stream for the fuel cell to preheat that air.</p>
<h4 id="field-zone-name-to-receive-skin-losses">Field: Zone Name to Receive Skin Losses</h4>

<p>This field describes the user’s choice for how the capacity of the auxiliary heater will be defined. There are two options:  “Watts” or “kmol/s.”  Entering Watts will direct the program to use the next two fields to determine the maximum and minimum heating capacity.  Entering kmol/s will direct the program to use the last two fields to determine the maximum and minimum heating capacities.</p>
<h4 id="field-maximum-heating-capacity-in-watts">Field: Maximum Heating Capacity in Watts</h4>

<h4 id="field-exhaust-outlet-air-node-name">Field: Exhaust Outlet Air Node Name</h4>
<p>This field is used to determine which node will receive the exhaust air stream leaving the FC. This node will usually be outside and not be referenced elsewhere. However, if the exhaust stream is used in a heat recovery ventilator (as described in section 11 of the Annex 42 specification) then the node would be reference in the heat recovery ventilator object.</p>
<h4 id="field-heat-exchanger-calculation-method">Field: Heat Exchanger Calculation Method</h4>
<p>This field is used to direct how EnergyPlus will calculate heat exchanger performance. The Annex 42 model provides for four different methods of modeling the heat exchanger. The choices available for this field are:  “FixedEffectiveness” (method 1 in Annex 42 specification),  “EmpiricalUAeff ” (method 2), “FundementalUAeff ” (method 3), or “Condensing” (method 4). The remaining fields provide input data for the different methods. The heat exchanger correlations are described below.</p>
<h4 id="field-method-1-heat-exchanger-effectiveness">Field: Method 1 Heat Exchanger Effectiveness</h4>
<p>This field describes constant heat exchanger effectiveness, <span>${\varepsilon_{HX}}$</span>. This field is only used with the “FixedEffectiveness” mode, which corresponds to “method 1” in the Annex 42 specification.

<h4 id="field-method-2-parameter-hxs0">Field: Method 2 Parameter hxs0</h4>
<p>This field describes the value of <span>$h{x_{s,0}}$</span> in the relation below for effective UA. This field is used with the “EmpiricalUAeff” mode, which corresponds to “method 2” in the Annex 42 specification and with the “Condensing” mode, which corresponds to “method 4”. This method uses the log mean temperature difference (LMTD) approach to calculate the heat exchange:</p>
<div>\[{q_{HX}} = {\left( {UA} \right)_{eff}} \cdot \frac{{\left( {{T_{aux - mix}} - {T_{water,out}}} \right) - \left( {{T_{HX - exh}} - {T_{water,in}}} \right)}}{{\ln \left( {\frac{{{T_{aux - mix}} - {T_{water,out}}}}{{{T_{HX - exh}} - {T_{water,in}}}}} \right)}}\]</div>

This field is only used with the “FundementalUAeff” mode, which corresponds to “method 3” in the Annex 42 specification. For this mode, the heat exchange is calculated using the LMTD method, but the effective UA is determined using:</p>
<div>\[{\left( {UA} \right)_{eff}} = {\left[ {\frac{1}{{{{\left( {hA} \right)}_{gas}}}} + \frac{1}{{{{(hA)}_{water}}}} + {F_{HX}}} \right]^{ - 1}}\]</div>

<p>where,</p>
<p><span>${F_{HX}}$</span> is an adjustment factor,</p>

<h3 id="photovoltaic-generators">Photovoltaic Generators</h3>
<p>EnergyPlus offers different options for predicting the electricity produced by solar electric photovoltaic (PV) panels. The three different options are “Simple”, “Equivalent One-Diode” and “Sandia” and the choice will determine the mathematical models used to determine energy production. The first allows the user to input an arbitrary efficiency. The other two models use empirical relationships to predict PV operating performance based on many environmental variables such as cell temperature.  The PV models can be used with either normal PV modules or as part of a hybrid photovoltaic/thermal (PVT) flat plat collector.</p>
<p>The generator is connected to an Electric Load Center.  The  PV models refer to surface input objects defined elsewhere in the input file.  This object describes an array that is “attached” to a surface object in order to describe its orientation and to access results of the solar insolation calculations. These can be either Heat Transfer or Shading objects (see Surfaces). This will define the orientation of the solar panel for the detailed models and also the area for the simple model. The exposure of that surface to incident solar radiation is calculated using the full set of models in EnergyPlus that are used to account for solar thermal loads arising from building windows and walls. Therefore the incident solar radiation is calculated to include the effects of shading and reflections from other surfaces declared in the input file. In addition to the output variables associated with PV models, there are numerous related output variables available for the surfaces including: 'Surface Outside Face Sunlit Area', 'Surface Outside Face Sunlit Fraction', 'Surface Outside Face Incident Solar Radiation Rate per Area', 'Surface Outside Face Incident Beam Solar Radiation Rate per Area', 'Surface Outside Face Incident Sky Diffuse Solar Radiation Rate per Area', 'Surface Outside Face Incident Ground Diffuse Solar Radiation Rate per Area', 'Surface Outside Face Beam Solar Incident Angle Cosine Value', 'Surface Outside Face Incident Sky Diffuse Ground Reflected Solar Radiation Rate per Area', 'Surface Outside Face Incident Sky Diffuse Surface Reflected Solar Radiation Rate per Area', 'Surface Outside Face Incident Beam To Beam Reflected From Surfaces Solar Radiation Rate per Area', 'Surface Outside Face Incident Beam To Diffuse Surface Reflected Solar Radiation Rate per Area', and 'Surface Outside Face Incident Beam To Diffuse Ground Reflected Solar Radiation Rate per Area.’  Note that it is possible to define a PV array area that doesn’t conform to the surface area (i.e. model a PV array area that is larger or smaller than what is available on the surface) so it is the users responsibility to not over-specify area when determining how many modules will fit onto a surface. However this type of input is allowed.</p>
<p>EnergyPlus does not include models for ancillary equipment for a PV array including charge controllers or power-point trackers. The operation of the entire electrical system that must go along with a PV array is not currently modeled in EnergyPlus and is therefore assumed to operate in ideal ways.  The PV production models do not resolve voltage and current, only power (and energy).  Electricity production is metered based on the output of the inverter. Output results are available before and after the inverter. One assumption is that the array is assumed to be always operating at the maximum power point. Energy production is based on the assumption that the quasi-steady power prediction is constant and continuous over the simulation timestep.</p>
<p>For a variety of reasons, actual installations of photovoltaics are often observed to exhibit system-level problems that significantly reduce electricity production. Therefore this modeling should be considered a method of bracketing the upper end of electricity production rather than an accurate prediction of what the panels will produce. Also note that the model predictions are closely related to the solar radiation data (typically of of TMY2 origin) in the EnergyPlus weather file, that the solar data in these is usually from a model rather than direct measurements, and that solar resources encountered by a real installation in a given year are likely to differ from the weather data file.</p>

<p><strong>IntegratedTranspiredCollector </strong> The cell temperature is obtained from the collector surface temperature in the unglazed transpired collector model.  Energy exported by the module is removed from the collector surface.  The input fields for Module Heat Capacity and Module Heat Loss Coefficient are ignored.</p>

<h3 id="photovoltaicperformancesandia">PhotovoltaicPerformance:Sandia</h3>
<p>This ‘PhotovoltaicPerformance:Sandia’ object describes the performance of a single type of module.  The model used with this object for predicting the electricity generated by photovoltaics is referred to as the Sandia model. This model is based on work done at Sandia National Lab, Albuquerque, NM by David King -- with the help of many others.</p>
<p>This object describes performance input data needed for specific makes and models of production PV panels using the empirical coefficients assembled by Sandia National Laboratory.  There are a large number of empirical coefficients required to use the Sandia model. These data are obtained after extensive measurements and data reduction. This testing has been performed for some types of production panels and Sandia publishes a database of module and array performance parameters on the web at www.sandia.gov/pv. The entries in the database as of January 15, 2004 were converted to idf segments and are included with the EnergyPlus release in the library file SandiaPVData.imf. There are more than hundred different module types included in the library and identified by the manufacturer’s model names listed at the beginning of the file SandiaPVData.imf. This data library file is arranged for use with EpMacro but the user can also copy .idf segments directly from the macro data set.</p>
<p>The Sandia model itself can aggregate multiple PV modules. Therefore, an instance of a ‘PhotovoltaicPerformance:Sandia’ object could actually represent an array of modules as well as the more usual single module. These can be can be thought of as simple larger modules and used by Generator:PV:Sandia objects in the usual manner.</p>
<p>The many empirical coefficients for the model are listed below and are described in more more detail in the EnergyPlus engineering documentation EngineeringDoc.pdf.</p>
<p>The field descriptions below focus on providing the parameter’s variable name as identified in the Sandia database. See the the EngineeringDoc.pdf for details on how the input fields are used in the correlations. The user generally would not need to worry about the details of the fields since he/she is not likely to generate the data on their own.</p>

<h3 id="generatorwindturbine">Generator:WindTurbine</h3>
<p>A wind turbine is a component that converts the kinetic energy of the surrounding airstream into electricity. This model is intended to calculate the electrical power that a wind turbine system produces. The performance of wind turbine systems is dependent on the local environmental conditions such as wind speed and density of air at the height of the systems. An analysis of these conditions is necessary to accurately estimate power output. The model obtains the weather information from the weather data file in EnergyPlus and then determines the wind speed and air density at the specific height of the system. It also requires the user to input the annual average wind speed measured at the local site and the height of the measurement so that it factors in differences between the weather file wind data and the local wind data.</p>
<p>The model employs the general kinetic energy equation to calculate the performance characteristics of the horizontal axis wind turbine (HAWT) systems. It provides a simple approximation algorithm when the power coefficient, Cp, is available which represents the efficiency of the wind turbine in the wind power extraction from the ambient air stream. It also allows the user to input experimental constants so that the power coefficient can precisely be determined according to the characteristic of the airfoil of the system. As for the vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT) systems, it employs the general mathematical equations for straight-bladed Darrieus-type VAWT systems, which are common to VAWT systems. Various types of VAWT systems such as the Savonius-type and the curved-blade (or Egg-beater) type may be simulated with this same model.</p>
<p>It includes two different types of dynamic power control: FixedSpeedFixedPitch (FSFP) and VariableSpeedFixedPitch (VSFP). Currently, it does not include an algorithm for modeling pitch control such as FixedSpeedVariablePitch (FSVP) and VariableSpeedVariablePitch (VSVP). If the control type of the wind turbine is either FSVP or VSVP, the control type of VSFP will be assumed. In addition, constant power generation is assumed when the ambient wind speed is between the rated wind speed and the cut out wind speed, if the user specifies one of the last three options. The model also has the ability to account for transient losses associate with the power produced during dynamic control by a user-specified fraction.</p>
<p>The model does not include detailed algorithms for generators and inverters due to concerns for computational convergence, time, and usability. Instead, all conversion losses of these subsystems are included by applying a user-supplied total system efficiency to the maximum power extraction of the wind turbine. The field of the total system efficiency must be specified by the user.</p>
<h4 id="field-name_175">Field: Name</h4>
<p>A unique user assigned name for a particular wind turbine system. Any reference to this unit by another object will use this name.</p>
<h4 id="field-availability-schedule-name_41">Field: Availability Schedule Name</h4>
<p>The name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the wind turbine system can run during a given time period. A schedule value greater than 0 (usually 1 is used) indicates that the unit can be on during the time period. A value less than or equal to 0 (usually 0 is used) denotes that the unit is off and will not operate for the time period. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.</p>
<h4 id="field-rotor-type">Field: Rotor Type</h4>
<p>This field is the type of axis of the wind turbine. The user specifies either a horizontal axis wind turbine or a vertical axis wind turbine. Each type of wind turbine employs a different algorithm for the calculation of the electrical power output of the wind turbine. The default value is HorizontalAxisWindTurbine.</p>
<h4 id="field-power-control">Field: Power Control</h4>
<p>This field is the type of rotor control for the wind turbine. This protects the system against the overloading for a system with no speed or pitch control and also to maximize the energy yield for the system. Four different control types are classified in the literature: FixedSpeedFixedPitch (FSFP), FixedSpeedVariablePitch (FSVP), VariableSpeedFixedPitch (VSFP), and VariableSpeedVariablePitch (VSVP). Currently, FSFP and VSFP types can be modeled in EnergyPlus. The other two types will be modeled as VSFP. If the first FSFP control type is chosen, the model assumes the maximum power at a fixed rotor speed when the power output predicted is greater than the maximum until the rotor speed reaches the maximum wind speed (see next field). If one of the last three control options is chosen, the model assumes that the system produces a constant power at the rated wind speed when the wind speed is between the rated wind speed and cut-out wind speed. The default value is VariableSpeedFixedPitch (VSFP).</p>
<h4 id="field-rated-rotor-speed">Field: Rated Rotor Speed</h4>
<p>This field is the maximum rotational speed of the rotor at the rated power of the wind turbine in rev/min (revolution per minute). It is used to determine the tip speed ratio of the rotor and relative flow velocity incident on a single blade of the VAWT systems.</p>
<h4 id="field-rotor-diameter">Field: Rotor Diameter</h4>
<p>This field is the diameter of the rotor in meters. Note that this field is not the height of the blade, but the diameter of the perpendicular circle from the vertical pole in the VAWT systems. It determines the swept area of the rotor of the HAWT systems and the chordal velocity of the VAWT systems.</p>
<h4 id="field-overall-height">Field: Overall Height</h4>
<p>This field is the height of the hub of the HAWT system, or of the pole of the VAWT system in meters. It is necessary to estimate local air density and the wind speed at this particular height where the wind turbine system is installed.</p>
<h4 id="field-number-of-blades">Field: Number of Blades</h4>
<p>This field is the number of blades of the wind turbine. The azimuth angle of the rotor of the VAWT system is determined by dividing 360 degree by this field so that the model determines the chordal velocity component and the normal velocity component of the system. The default value is 3.</p>
<h4 id="field-rated-power_1">Field: Rated Power</h4>
<p>This field is the nominal power output of the wind turbine system at the rated wind speed in Watts. Note that the user should input the maximum power of the system with no control, i.e., FSFP control type, can physically produce. Manufacturers’ data also indicates it as “peak power” or “rated capacity”. If the local wind speed is greater than the rated wind speed, the model assumes constant power output of this field.</p>
<h4 id="field-rated-wind-speed">Field: Rated Wind Speed</h4>
<p>This field is the wind speed that the wind turbine system indicates the peak in the power curve in m/s. The system produces the maximum power at this speed and the speed of the rotor is managed based on this wind speed.</p>
<h4 id="field-cut-in-wind-speed">Field: Cut In Wind Speed</h4>
<p>This field is the lowest wind speed where the wind turbine system can be operated in m/s. No power generation is achieved as long as the ambient wind speed is lower than this speed.</p>
<h4 id="field-cut-out-wind-speed">Field: Cut Out Wind Speed</h4>
<p>This field is the greatest wind speed in m/s. When the wind speed exceeds this value, the wind turbine system needs to be stopped because of inefficiencies in the system. All systems that have either pitch or speed control must be stopped when the ambient wind speed exceeds this speed. Note that the user should input a wind speed above which physical damage to the system might be caused in the case of a FSFP system. It appears as “extreme/survival/design wind speed” in the literature. The system will be turned off when the ambient wind speed is over this speed.</p>
<h4 id="field-fraction-system-efficiency">Field: Fraction System Efficiency</h4>
<p>This field is the overall system efficiency of the wind turbine system. It includes all the conversion losses as well as transient losses during the dynamic control when the ambient wind speed is between the rated wind speed and cut-out wind speed (see previous fields). The user also has the ability to specify delivery losses from the system to the local area. If the user does not enter a fraction, the model assumes the default value of 0.835. Note that the fraction must be between zero and one.</p>
<h4 id="field-maximum-tip-speed-ratio">Field: Maximum Tip Speed Ratio</h4>
<p>This field is the maximum tip speed ratio between the rotor velocity and ambient wind velocity. The rotor speed varies with this ratio to maximize the power output when the rotor control types are variable speed ones. This field allows the user to adjust the power output from the particular system or to find the optimal tip speed ratio of the system. Optimal tip speed ratio is dependent on the number of blades. It is typically about 6, 5, and 3 for two-bladed, three-bladed, and four-bladed rotor, respectively.  For the vertical axis wind turbine, it is smaller than horizontal axis wind turbine, and varies with the chord area. The default and maximum values are 5.0 and 12.0.</p>
<h4 id="field-maximum-power-coefficient">Field: Maximum Power Coefficient</h4>
<p>This field is the maximum fraction of power extraction from ambient wind. If the user inputs this field, the simple approximation model is assumed. The model simply employs the value of this field into the general kinetic energy equation, so that the power output is obtained. The user can obtain this field with a simple calculation from the power curve published in almost all manufacturers' specifications by using the kinetic energy equation as:</p>
<div>\[{C_p} = \frac{P}{{0.5\rho A{V^3}}}\]</div>

<p>where</p>
<p><em>P</em> = power production at the rated wind speed [W]</p>
<p><em>ρ</em> = density of air [kg/m3]</p>
<p><em>A</em> = swept area of rotor [m2]</p>
<p><em>V</em> = rated wind speed [m/s]</p>
<p><em>C<sub>p</sub></em> = power coefficient</p>
<p>The maximum and default values are 0.59 and 0.35.</p>
<h4 id="field-annual-local-average-wind-speed">Field: Annual Local Average Wind Speed</h4>
<p>This field is the local annual average wind speed that represents a representative wind profile at the location of the system in m/s. It is used to factor the difference in wind speed between the weather file wind data and the locally measured wind data so that the model minimizes uncertainties caused by improper wind data at the particular location. Considerable differences between the weather file wind data and the local wind data typically appear. The user thus needs to enter this field in order to obtain accurate local wind data. The model internally determines a multiplier and it is multiplied by the weather file wind data adjusted at the height of the system. If this field is not entered, then the model will use the wind speed from the design day or weather file information with only adjustment at the height of the rotor.</p>
<h4 id="field-height-for-local-average-wind-speed">Field: Height for Local Average Wind Speed</h4>
<p>This field is the height that the local wind speed is measured in meters. The annual average wind speed (see previous field) input by the user is internally recalculated by existing EnergyPlus functions at the height of the local station. This modified wind speed is then factored and applied to the weather file wind data. If the annual local average wind speed is not entered, this field is then assumed as zero. The minimum and default values are zero and 50 meters.</p>
<h4 id="field-blade-chord-area">Field: Blade Chord Area</h4>
<p>This field is the blade chord area of a single blade of VAWT system in m2. It is necessary to determine the net tangential and normal forces of a single blade.</p>
<h4 id="field-blade-drag-coefficient">Field: Blade Drag Coefficient</h4>
<p>This field is the blade drag coefficient for a specific blade. It is for determining the tangential and normal force coefficients with the blade lift coefficient (see next field) so that the model can calculate the power output from the system. The user should be able to obtain this parameter for a specific blade from the manufacturers’ data. This field is only valid for VAWT systems.</p>
<h4 id="field-blade-lift-coefficient">Field: Blade Lift Coefficient</h4>
<p>This field is the blade lift coefficient for a specific blade. It is for determining the tangential and normal force coefficients with the blade drag coefficient (see previous field) so that the model can calculate the power output from the system. The user should also be able to obtain it for a specific blade from the manufacturers’ data. This field is only valid for VAWT systems.</p>
<h4 id="field-power-coefficient-parameter-x">Field: Power Coefficient Parameter &lt;x&gt;</h4>
<p>These six fields are the parameters for the power coefficient equation shown below. These fields are used to determine the power coefficient of the system. The analytical approximation model of the power coefficient in EnergyPlus is:</p>
<div>\[{C_p} = {C_1}(\frac{{{C_2}}}{{{\lambda_i}}} - {C_3}\theta  - {C_4}{\theta ^x} - {C_5}){e^{ - \frac{{{C_6}(\lambda ,\theta )}}{{{\lambda_i}}}}}\]</div>

<p>with</p>
<div>\[\frac{1}{{{\lambda_i}}} = \frac{1}{{\lambda  + 0.08\theta }} - \frac{{0.035}}{{{\theta ^3} + 1}}\]</div>

<p>where</p>
<p><em>C<sub>p</sub></em>     = power coefficient</p>
<p>C<em><sub>1-\ 6</sub></em>  = empirical power coefficient parameters</p>
<p><em>λ</em>        = tip speed ratio (often known as TSR)</p>
<p><em>λi</em>       = tip speed ratio at ith time step</p>
<p><em>θ</em>       = azimuth angle of the pitch, 0 [degree]</p>
<p>If the user does not input any field of these parameters, the simple approximation model for the power coefficient will be used (see previous maximum power coefficient field). That is, the analytical approximation model of the power coefficient will be chosen only if the user inputs all these six parameters. The user also has the ability to modify each parameter when the specific value of the system is available. The default values are given in the table below.</p>
<table class="table table-striped">

<h2 id="group-water-systems">Group – Water Systems</h2>
<p>This group of objects is used to describe the water systems in the building. EnergyPlus offers water modeling capabilities than include not only hot water systems but also the overall water systems including cold water uses, on-site water collection (e.g., from rain, condensate, or well), and storage. HVAC components may consume or collect a significant portion of the water making it appropriate to include water modeling in EnergyPlus.</p>
<p>All water systems are collected into an end use category called “Water Systems”. This category includes hot and cold water. Water consumed by an HVAC component will be assigned to the end use category for that component. End use subcategories are available to separate hot water from cold water if desired. Simple hot water systems can be configured as stand-alone or use a PlantLoop. The Water Systems can be connected to PlantLoops for modeling heated water end uses. However PlantLoops are not used to model cold water and the WaterUse:Storages portions of the water system. Cold water systems are connected together using WaterUse:Storage objects. WaterUse:Connections are used at the zone level to connect to both cold and hot water.</p>
<p>In addition to the input objects described in this section below, there are a variety of HVAC components that can be configured to interact with the water systems. These component input objects include optional fields that allow describing how the water systems are connected to them by providing the name of a storage tank. The following table lists EnergyPlus input objects that include provisions for connecting to the water systems but are described elsewhere in this document:</p>

<h3 id="wateruseequipment">WaterUse:Equipment</h3>
<p>The WaterUse:Equipment object is a generalized object for simulating all water end uses. Hot and cold water uses are included, as well as controlled mixing of hot and cold water at the tap. The WaterUse:Equipment object can be used stand-alone, or coupled into a plant loop using the WaterUse:Connections object (see below). The WaterUse:Connections object allows water uses to be linked to WaterUse:Storage objects to store and draw reclaimed water. The WaterUse:Connections object can also simulate drainwater heat recovery.</p>
<p>The WaterUse:Equipment object serves all of the same purposes as the existing objects:  Exterior:WaterEquipment, and HotWaterEquipment.</p>
<p>The WaterUse:Equipment object does a better job of modeling domestic hot water by allowing mixing at the tap in order to account for both hot <strong>and cold</strong> water used at sinks, showers, etc. It also improves on the stand-alone energy modeling of domestic hot water. Because all of the temperatures and flow rates can be solved, the energy usage can be accounted for as "Purchased Heating".</p>
<p>In either stand-alone mode or used with the WaterUse:Connections object, the WaterUse:Equipment object will attempt to meet a scheduled target temperature at the tap by mixing hot and cold water flows. If the hot water flow is not hot enough, or if the flow is limited by plant loop constraints, the result is a cooler mixed water temperature and the target temperature will not be met. In stand-alone mode the hot and cold water temperatures are specified by schedules. However, if the cold water schedule is omitted, the water temperature will be calculated by the Site:WaterMainsTemperature object. If the hot water schedule or target temperature schedule are omitted, all water is delivered as cold water. If only using cold water, the WaterUse:Equipment object is similar to the Exterior:WaterEquipment object.</p>
<p>The WaterUse:Equipment object improves on the internal gains object HotWaterEquipment by associating actual water usage with a sensible and latent gain to a zone. Equipment, such as showers, that generate a significant heat gain can be modeled using the Sensible Fraction Schedule and Latent Fraction Schedule fields. The schedules are used to set the fraction of the maximum possible heat gain (based on inlet water conditions and ambient zone conditions) that should be added to the zone. The split between sensible and latent will vary depending on the type of equipment that is to be modeled. Typically, both fractions should be small numbers.</p>
<h4 id="field-name_176">Field: Name</h4>
<p>The unique object name for reference by other objects.</p>
<h4 id="field-end-use-subcategory_6">Field: End-Use Subcategory</h4>
<p>Allows you to specify a user-defined end-use subcategory, e.g., "Laundry", "Dish Washing", etc. A new meter for reporting is created for each unique subcategory (ref: Output:Meter objects). Subcategories are also reported in the ABUPS table under the "Water Systems" end-use category. If this field is omitted or blank, the water use will be assigned to the "General" end-use subcategory.</p>
<h4 id="field-peak-flow-rate_1">Field: Peak Flow Rate</h4>

<h4 id="field-target-temperature-schedule-name">Field: Target Temperature Schedule Name</h4>
<p>Reference to the schedule object specifying the target water temperature [C]. Hot and cold water are mixed at the tap to attain the target temperature. If insufficient hot water is available to reach the target temperature, the result is cooler water at the tap. If blank, the target temperature defaults to the hot water supply temperature.</p>
<h4 id="field-hot-water-supply-temperature-schedule-name">Field: Hot Water Supply Temperature Schedule Name</h4>
<p>Reference to the schedule object specifying the hot water temperature [C]. The hot water temperature is used to calculate the "Purchased Heating" energy usage in stand-alone mode. If blank in stand-alone mode, the hot water supply temperature defaults to the cold water supply temperature. This field is ignored if the object is used with the WaterUse:Connections object.</p>
<h4 id="field-cold-water-supply-temperature-schedule-name">Field: Cold Water Supply Temperature Schedule Name</h4>
<p>Reference to the Schedule object specifying the cold water temperature [C] from the supply mains that provides the cold water to the tap and makes up for all water lost down the drain. If blank, water temperatures are calculated by the Site:WaterMainsTemperature object. This field is ignored if the object is used with the WaterUse:Connections object.</p>
<h4 id="field-zone-name_16">Field: Zone Name</h4>
<p>Reference to the zone name where the water equipment will be considered as latent load to the zone.</p>
<h4 id="field-sensible-fraction-schedule-name">Field: Sensible Fraction Schedule Name</h4>
<p>Reference to the schedule object specifying the fraction of the maximum possible sensible heat gain (based on inlet water conditions and ambient zone conditions) that is added to the zone. If blank, the schedule defaults to 0 at all times.</p>

<p>Reference to the schedule object specifying the fraction of the maximum possible latent heat gain (based on inlet water conditions and ambient zone conditions) that is added to the zone. If blank, the schedule defaults to 0 at all times.</p>

<h3 id="wateruseconnections">WaterUse:Connections</h3>
<p>The WaterUse:Connections object can be thought of as a subsystem that groups together multiple WaterUse:Equipment components. As its name suggests, the object provides connections that are shared by these components, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Inlet node and outlet node connections to a plant loop</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Connections to WaterUse:Storage objects to store and draw reclaimed water</p>
</li>

</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Water Use Connections IO Diagram" src="../../InputOutputReference/media/image579.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 153. Diagram of internal connections for WaterUse:Connections</p>
<p>The WaterUse:Connections object can be used stand-alone or coupled into a plant loop. In stand-alone mode, the Hot and Cold Water Supply Temperature Schedules override the values for the listed WaterUse:Equipment objects. When coupled to the plant, the Hot Water Supply Temperature Schedule is overridden by the actual plant loop inlet water temperature. When coupled to the plant, the WaterUse:Connections object should be on a Branch object whose control type is set to “Active.”</p>
<h4 id="field-name_177">Field: Name</h4>
<p>The unique object name for reference by other objects.</p>
<h4 id="field-inlet-node-name_11">Field: Inlet Node Name</h4>
<p>The hot water inlet node when connected to a plant loop. The hot water supplies all of the WaterUse:Equipment objects that demand hot water. Insufficient supply temperature or flow results in cooler water at the tap.</p>

<p>The cold water outlet node, i.e. the cold water supply mains, when connected to a plant loop. The return node provides make-up water for the hot water lost down the drain.</p>
<h4 id="field-supply-water-storage-tank-name_6">Field: Supply Water Storage Tank Name</h4>
<p>Reference to the WaterUse:Storage object that supplies cold water to the listed WaterUse:Equipment objects. If the field is blank, or the tank is empty, fresh water is supplied from the water mains.</p>
<h4 id="field-reclamation-water-storage-tank-name">Field: Reclamation Water Storage Tank Name</h4>
<p>Reference to the WaterUse:Storage object that stores the resulting graywater from the listed WaterUse:Equipment objects. If the field is blank, the graywater is not reclaimed.</p>

<h4 id="field-drain-water-heat-exchanger-type">Field: Drain Water Heat Exchanger Type</h4>
<p>The heat exchanger type to be used for drainwater heat recovery. None indicates no heat recovery is to be simulated. Ideal sets a heat exchanger effectiveness of 1.0. Effectiveness is calculated dynamically for CounterFlow and CrossFlow options.</p>
<p>One popular type of drainwater heat exchanger is the Gravity-Film Heat Exchanger (GFX). The GFX is most closely approximated with the CounterFlow option, but keep in mind that the UA varies more with flow rate for the GFX than for most traditional heat exchangers.</p>
<h4 id="field-drain-water-heat-exchanger-destination">Field: Drain Water Heat Exchanger Destination</h4>
<p>The heat exchanger configuration to be used for drainwater heat recovery. The configuration determines where the heat will be used after it is recovered.</p>

<h3 id="waterusestorage">WaterUse:Storage</h3>
<p>The WaterUse:Storage object is a central component for complex water systems. This object is not needed if the only use of water is directly from the mains, or utility service water. If the building model is to include any on-site collection or wells or storing and reuse of graywater, then a WaterUse:Storage is needed. Each WaterUse:Storage can serve as a central node and make connections to numerous sources of supply or numerous components with demand. If a maximum capacity is not specified, the tank is assumed to have unlimited capacity. This is useful for sizing.</p>
<p>Storage tanks may handle a lot of water but show no use. This is because water usage is metered at the component level were water is “used up.”  The only water a storage tank might use up is overflow water if it is discarded.</p>

Used if the well or other tank cannot keep up with the needs of the main float valve. If left blank or equal 0.0, then there is no mains water backup. If specified, then mains water will be drawn once the storage tank reaches this level and then the mains water will fill all the way to capacity specified in the previous field.</p>
<h4 id="field-other-tank-name">Field: Other Tank Name</h4>
<p>This field contains the name of another WaterUse:Storage defined elsewhere in the input file. This field is only used if the Type of Controlled Supply field is set to ‘OtherTank’ and the current tank is to be configured to be supplied by a second tank in response to a float valve.</p>
<h4 id="field-water-thermal-mode">Field: Water Thermal Mode</h4>

<h2 id="group-operational-faults">Group – Operational Faults</h2>
<h3 id="introduction-to-operational-faults-modeling">Introduction to Operational Faults Modeling</h3>
<p>Most of the buildings, either new or old, have operational faults in the sensors, controllers, meters, equipment and systems. Being able to model and simulate these faults and their impact on energy performance of buildings is crucial to improve accuracy of building simulations and to support the retrofit of buildings.</p>
<p>To date, the main practitioner use of EnergyPlus has been for new construction design. With the new high priority attached by USDOE to retrofit and improved operation of existing buildings, there is a need to extend the capabilities of EnergyPlus to model existing buildings, including faulty operation:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Retrofit analysis: starts with calibrated simulation; the ability to estimate the severity of common faults is expected to improve the accuracy and transparency of the calibrated model and hence the increase accuracy of the analysis of different retrofit measures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Commissioning providers can use the fault models to demonstrate the saving to be expected from fixing faults found in retro-commissioning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support for building operation by using the calibrated model, including unfixed faults, as a real-time reference model to detect, and verify the diagnosis of, newly occurring faults.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The users in these cases are practitioners, not power users, so it is needed to implement the fault models using conventional EnergyPlus objects rather than the EMS, which, in any case, could only be used to model limited types of faults.</p>
<h3 id="operational-fault-objects">Operational Fault Objects</h3>
<p>EnergyPlus contains a number of objects to model operational faults of sensors, meters, equipment and systems. The current implementation allows the model of sensors faults with air economizers and heating and cooling coil fouling.</p>

<h2 id="group-performance-curves">Group – Performance Curves</h2>
<p>This group of objects primarily consists of polynomial curves that are used to characterize the performance of HVAC equipment. Several other non-polynomial curves are also included to characterize the performance of pumps and fans. All of the curves are input, stored, and evaluated entirely within the CurveManager module. The curves are usually derived from fits or regressions to data covering a limited range. Results for independent variable values outside this range are likely to be invalid, so curve input always contains a range of validity (maximum and minimum permitted values) for each independent variable and can optionally have limits on the curve ouput. No error or warning message is issued if an independent variable is outside the range. Instead, the curve manager uses the minimum value if an independent variable is less than the minimum, and the maximum if a variable exceeds the maximum. Similarly, no error or warning message is issued if the curve output is outside the range of the optional minimum and maximum curve output limits. Instead, the curve manager uses the minimum and maximum curve limits to cap the output of the performance curve.</p>
<p>Curve names must be unique across all curve types.</p>
<h3 id="curvelinear">Curve:Linear</h3>

<h3 id="curvefunctionalpressuredrop">Curve:Functional:PressureDrop</h3>
<p>Input for a pressure drop curve consists of the curve name, a varying number of parameters, and the maximum and minimum valid independent variable values. The equation represented by the pressure drop curve is:</p>
<div>\[\Delta P = \left( {K + f\frac{L}{D}} \right)\frac{{\rho {V^2}}}{2}\]</div>

<h4 id="field-name_196">Field: Name</h4>
<p>A user assigned unique name for an instance of a pressure drop curve. When a curve is used, it is referenced by this name.</p>
<h4 id="field-diameter">Field: Diameter</h4>
<p>This diameter represents an equivalent diameter for the given branch. This is parameter (D) in the equation, and has units of {m}. Since varying components may be found on the same branch, this value must be selected along with the other inputs in order to provide a proper value of pressure drop. This is used to calculate the velocity in addition to being used directly in the frictional pressure drop calculation.</p>
<h4 id="field-minor-loss-coefficient">Field: Minor Loss Coefficient</h4>
<p>This is the pressure drop coefficient typically applied to components such as fittings and occasionally heat pumps. This is parameter (K) in the equation and is dimensionless. This coefficient is used to describe the amount of dynamic pressure lost during the process. This value may be left blank if the user only wants to account for frictional losses in this branch.</p>
<h4 id="field-length">Field: Length</h4>
<p>This is the length of a pressure drop process in which friction is applied. This is parameter (L) in the equation and has units of {m}. In a pipe, this would be the length of the pipe, however in many cases, pressure drop in other components are applied as an “equivalent length.”  This is only required if the user is wanting to perform frictional pressure drop calculations.</p>
<h4 id="field-roughness">Field: Roughness</h4>
<p>This field represents the first method to simulate frictional losses. This parameter does not appear directly in the equation above, as it is only used to develop the friction factor (f), but the roughness will have units of {m} if entered. If the user enters this roughness value, the pressure system will use it along with an approximation to the Moody chart to estimate the friction factor given the current flow conditions. This allows the friction calculate to be dynamic throughout the simulation.</p>
<h4 id="field-fixed-friction-factor">Field: Fixed Friction Factor</h4>
<p>This field represents the second method to simulate frictional losses. This is parameter (f) in the equation and is dimensionless. This parameter is a fixed value of friction factor which would override any calculations performed based on roughness, etc. If the user has a known friction factor for a given component, this is where it should be entered.</p>

<h3 id="curvefanpressurerise">Curve:FanPressureRise</h3>
<p>Input for the fan total pressure rise curve consists of the curve name, the four coefficients, and the maximum and minimum valid independent variable values. Optional inputs for the curve minimum and maximum may be used to limit the output of the performance curve (e.g., limit extrapolation). The equation is:</p>
<div>\[\Delta {P_{fan,tot}} = {C_1}*Q_{fan}^2 + {C_2}*Q_{fan}^{} + {C_3}*Q_{fan}^{}*\sqrt {{P_{sm}} - {P_o}}  + {C_4}*\left( {{P_{sm}} - {P_o}} \right)\]</div>

<p>where Δ<em>P<sub>fan,tot</sub></em> is the fan total pressure rise (Pa) as a function of volumetric flow through the fan (<em>Q<sub>fan</sub></em>, m<sup>3</sup>/s), duct static pressure set point (<em>P<sub>sm</sub></em>, Pa), and static pressure surrounding the ducts (<em>P<sub>o</sub></em>, Pa). <em>P<sub>o</sub></em> is assumed to be zero.</p>
<p>The first term of the curve looks like the common system curve in which the fan pressure rise is proportional to the square of the fan flow, but here it also depends implicitly on supply and return pressure losses, and in part on the fraction of the fan flow that is outdoor air (essentially “leaks” into and out of the return side of the system). Very often it is the only term considered, but that would only be correct with fixed-position dampers, no distribution system leakage, no linear resistance components, and no duct static pressure control.</p>
<p>The second term accounts for significant flow resistances in the system where the pressure difference is linearly proportional to the flow. Some filters and coils in the return may need this term to be adequately described. This term could be ignored if there are no linear components or if their pressure drops are very small compared to the other terms.</p>
<p>The third term, which depends on the fan flow and square root of the supply duct pressure <em>P<sub>sm</sub></em>, accounts in part for leakage from the supply system when damper positions are fixed or are changed independently of static pressure or fan flow. In this case, reducing or eliminating supply leakage results in a different system curve. This, however, might be only a minor “correction” to the simple system curves generally used. The third term is zero when the VAV box dampers are modulated to control flow. Consequently, with variable-position supply dampers, reducing or eliminating supply leakage does not change the system curve.</p>
<p>The last term also accounts in part for leakage from the supply system when damper positions are fixed or are changed independently of static pressure or fan flow. This term indicates that the same fan pressure rise can be achieved by raising the duct pressure and closing dampers. The only change in the system in such a case is that the leakage flow may increase. The coefficient for this term is one when the VAV box dampers are modulated to control flow. In both cases, this term may be the most important “correction” to the simple system curves generally used, especially at low flows.</p>

<h3 id="performance-curve-outputs">Performance Curve Outputs</h3>
<h4 id="performance-curve-output-value">Performance Curve Output Value</h4>
<p>The current value of the performance curve. This value is averaged over the time step being reported. Inactive or unused performance curves will show a value of -999 (e.g., equipment is off, a specific performance curve is not required for this aspect of the equipment model at this time step, etc.). This value means that the performance curve was not called during the simulation and, therefore, not evaluated. This inactive state value is only set at the beginning of each environment. When averaging over long periods of time, this inactive state value may skew results. In this case, use a detaled reporting frequency (ref. Output:Variable object) to view results at each HVAC time step.</p>
<h4 id="performance-curve-input-variable-1-n-value">Performance Curve Input Variable 1(-N) Value []</h4>

<h2 id="group-performance-tables">Group – Performance Tables</h2>
<p>This group of objects consists of tabular data which are used to characterize the performance of HVAC equipment. The use of performance tables eliminate the need to perform a regression analysis to calculate the performance curve equation coefficients. Two performance tables are available to represent any performance curve having one or two independent variables. The tabular data is entered as data pairs and represent each independent variable followed by the table output at that condition. When using these two performance table objects, a regression analysis may be performed during the simulation to create the associated performance curve. The regression analysis is performed when the user requests to evaluate the curve to the limits specified (see Interpolation Method input field). The performance curve that is created is used throughout the simulation and is also written to the eio file when the user sets the diagnostics output flag DisplayAdvancedVariables (ref. Output:Diagnostics, DisplayAdvancedVariables)  This performance curve object may be directly used in future input files. The following descriptions define the input requirements for the performance table objects.</p>
<h3 id="tableoneindependentvariable">Table:OneIndependentVariable</h3>
<p>Input for the data table consists of a table name, the curve type, the interpolation method, and the data pairs representing the polynomial equation. Optional inputs for minimum and maximum values for the independent variable and curve minimum and maximum may be used to limit the output of the table when evaluating the regression curve (e.g., limit extrapolation). The existing performance curves represented by this table object are:</p>
<div>\[Linear\,\,Curve:\,\,\,Output = {C_1} + {C_2}x\]</div>

<div>\[Quadratic\,\,Curve:\,\,\,Output = {C_1} + {C_2}x + {C_3}{x^2}\]</div>

<div>\[Cubic\,\,Curve:\,\,\,Output = {C_1} + {C_2}x + {C_3}{x^2} + {C_4}{x^3}\]</div>

<div>\[Quartic\,\,Curve:\,\,\,Output = {C_1} + {C_2}x + {C_3}{x^2} + {C_4}{x^3} + {C_5}{x^4}\]</div>

<div>\[Exponent\,\,Curve:\,\,\,Output = {C_1} + {C_2}{x^{{C_3}}}\]</div>

<h4 id="field-name_205">Field: Name</h4>
<p>A unique user assigned name for an instance of a performance table. When a table is used, it is referenced by this name. The name of this table object may be used anywhere a valid performance curve object is allowed.</p>
<h4 id="field-curve-type">Field: Curve Type</h4>
<p>The form of the polynomial equation used to represent the tabular data. Choices are <em>Linear</em>, <em>Quadratic</em>, <em>Cubic</em>, <em>Quartic</em> and <em>Exponent</em>. This field is used to determine if this table object is representative of the type of performance table (curve) allowed for a particular application (i.e., if this type of polynomial is allowed to be used as the curve type for other objects). This input infers the polynomial order (or degree). This input also specifies the number of interpolation points if the next field, Interpolation Method is set to LagrangeInterpolationLinearExtrapolation. The number of interpolation points for Linear, Quadratic, Cubic, Quartic, and Exponent are set at 2, 3, 4, 5, and 4, respectively.</p>
<h4 id="field-interpolation-method">Field: Interpolation Method</h4>
<p>The method used to evaluate the tabular data. Choices are <em>LinearInterpolationOfTable, LagrangeInterpolationLinearExtrapolation</em> and <em>EvaluateCurveToLimits</em>. When <em>LinearInterpolationOfTable</em> is selected, the tabular data is interpolated within the limits of the data set and the following fields are used only within the boundary of the table limits (i.e., are only used to limit interpolation). Extrapolation of the data set is not allowed. When <em>LagrangeInterpolationLinearExtrapolation</em> is selected, a polynomial interpolation routine is used within the table boundaries along with linear extrapolation. Given the valid one independent variable equations above, the polynomial order is up to 5<sup>th</sup> order. When <em>EvaluateCurveToLimits</em> is selected, the coefficients (i.e., C in the equations above) of the polynomial equation are calculated and used to determine the table output within the limits specified in the following fields. If these fields are not entered, the limits of the tabular data are used. The minimum number of data pairs required for this choice are 2, 3, 4, 5, and 4 data pairs for linear, quadratic, cubic, quartic, and exponent curves, respectively. If insufficient data is provided, the regression analysis is not performed and the simulation reverts to interpolating the tabular data. The performance curve is written to the eio file when the output diagnotics flag DisplayAdvancedVariables is used (ref. Output:Diagnostics, DisplayAdvancedVariables).</p>

<h4 id="field-normalization-reference">Field: Normalization Reference</h4>
<p>The normalization point for the data set. This field provides a method for automatically normalizing a set of data. Equipment performance data is typically normalized based on a specific operating condition. Both the output values and minimum/maximum curve limits are normalized. This normalization can be performed simply by entering the data at the reference point. If this field is left blank or a 1 is entered, the data set is assumed to be in the correct format.</p>
<h4 id="data-pairs">Data Pairs</h4>
<p>The following inputs describe the data set. Data pairs are entered as X and Output pairs where X is the independent variable (i.e., x in the equation above) and Output is the dependent variable (i.e., Output in the equation above). Any number of data pairs may be entered, however, a minimum number of data pairs must be entered and depends on the polynomial equation. Linear (1<sup>st</sup> order), Quadratic (2<sup>nd</sup> order), Cubic (3<sup>rd</sup> order), Quartic (4<sup>th</sup> order), and Exponent (nth order) polynomials require a minimum of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 4 data pairs, respectively. This minimum requirement is for performing a regression analysis, not interpolating the tabular data. If a regression analysis is not performed (i.e., only table interpolation is used), these minimum requirements are not enforced. If a regression analysis is performed and these minimum requirements are not met, the simulation will revert to table interpolation. These fields may be repeated as many times as necessary to define the tabular data.</p>
<h4 id="field-x-value-35n">Field: X Value #n</h4>
<p>The value of the independent variable n (i.e., independent variable values for data 1 to number of data pairs).</p>
<h4 id="field-output-value-35n">Field: Output Value #n</h4>
<p>The value of the dependent variable n (i.e., dependent variable values for data 1 to number of data pairs).</p>
<p>Following is an example input for a Table:OneIndependentVariable object:</p>

<h3 id="performance-table-outputs">Performance Table Outputs</h3>
<h4 id="performance-curve-output-value_1">Performance Curve Output Value []</h4>
<p>The current value of the performance table. Performance curves and tables use the same output variable. This value is averaged over the time step being reported. Inactive or unused performance curves will show a value of -999 (e.g., equipment is off, a specific performance curve is not required for this aspect of the equipment model at this time step, etc.). This value means that the performance curve was not called during the simulation and, therefore, not evaluated. This inactive state value is only set at the beginning of each environment. When averaging over long periods of time, this inactive state value may skew results. In this case, use a detaled reporting frequency (ref. Output:Variable object) to view results at each HVAC time step.</p>
<h4 id="performance-curve-input-variable-1-value">Performance Curve Input Variable 1 Value []</h4>
<p>The current value of the independent variable passed to the performance curve. This value is averaged over the time step being reported.</p>
<p>HVAC,Average,Performance Curve Output Value []</p>
<p>HVAC,Average,Performance Curve Input Variable 1 Value []</p>
<h3 id="tabletwoindependentvariables">Table:TwoIndependentVariables</h3>
<p>Input for the data table consists of a table name, the curve type, the interpolation method, and the data pairs representing the polynomial equation. Optional inputs for minimum and maximum values for the independent variable, and curve minimum and maximum may be used to limit the output of the table (e.g., limit extrapolation) when evaluating the regression curve instead of the tabular data. The polynomial equations currently represented by this table object are:</p>
<div>\[BiQuadratic\,\,Curve:\,\,\,\,Output = {C_1} + {C_2}x + {C_3}{x^2} + {C_4}y + {C_5}{y^2} + {C_6}xy\]</div>

<div>\[QuadraticLinear\,\,Curve:\,\,\,\,Output = {C_1} + {C_2}x + {C_3}{x^2} + {C_4}y + {C_5}xy + {C_6}{x^2}y\]</div>

<h4 id="field-name_206">Field: Name</h4>
<p>A unique user assigned name for an instance of a performance table. When a table is used, it is referenced by this name. The name of this table object may be used anywhere a valid performance curve object is allowed.</p>
<h4 id="field-curve-type_1">Field: Curve Type</h4>
<p>The form of the polynomial equation represented by the entered data. The only valid choices are <em>BiQuadratic</em> and <em>QuadraticLinear</em>. This field is used to determine if this table object is representative of the type of performance table (curve) allowed for a particular equipment model (i.e., if this type of polynomial is allowed to be used as the curve type for specific input fields). A minimum of 6 data pairs are required when selecting <em>EvaluateCurveToLimits</em> in the following field. This input also specifies the number of interpolation points if the next field, Interpolation Method is set to LagrangeInterpolationLinearExtrapolation. The number of interpolation points for BiQuadratic and QuadraticLinear are set at 6.</p>
<h4 id="field-interpolation-method_1">Field: Interpolation Method</h4>
<p>The method used to evaluate the tabular data. Choices are <em>LinearInterpolationOfTable, LagrangeInterpolationLinearExtrapolation,</em> and <em>EvaluateCurveToLimits</em>. When <em>LinearInterpolationOfTable</em> is selected, the data entered is evaluated within the limits of the data set and the following fields are used only within the boundary of the table limits (i.e., are only used to limit interpolation). A complete data set is required. For each X variable, entries must include all Y variables and associated curve output (i.e., a complete table, no gaps or missing data). Extrapolation of the data set is not allowed. When Lagrange<em>InterpolationLinearExtrapolation</em> is selected, a polynomial interpolation routine is used within the table boundaries along with linear extrapolation. Given the valid equations above, the polynomial order is fixed at 2 which infers that 3 data points will be used for interpolation. When <em>EvaluateCurveToLimits</em> is selected, the coefficients (i.e., C in the equations above) of the polynomial equation are calculated and used to determine the table output within the limits specified in the following fields (or the tabular data, whichever provide the larger range). If the following fields are not entered, the limits of the data set are used. A complete table is not required when using this method, however, a minimum number of data is required to perform the regression analysis. The minimum number of data pairs required for this choice is 6 data pairs for both bi-quadratic and quadratic-linear curve types. If insufficient data is provided, the simulation reverts to interpolating the tabular data. The performance curve is written to the eio file when the output diagnotics flag DisplayAdvancedVariables is used (ref. Output:Diagnostics, DisplayAdvancedVariables).</p>

<h4 id="field-normalization-reference_1">Field: Normalization Reference</h4>
<p>The normalization point for the data set. This field provides a method for automatically normalizing a set of data. Equipment performance data is typically normalized based on a specific operating condition. Both the output values and minimum/maximum curve limits are normalized as applicable. This normalization can be performed simply by entering the data at the reference point. If this field is left blank or a 1 is entered, the data set is assumed to be in the correct format.</p>
<h4 id="data-pairs_1">Data Pairs</h4>
<p>The following inputs describe the data set. Data pairs are entered as X, Y and Output pairs where X and Y are the independent variables (i.e., x and y in the equations above) and Output is the dependent variable (i.e., Output in the equation above). Any number of data pairs may be entered, however, a minimum number of data pairs must be entered and depends on the polynomial equation. BiQuadratic and QuadraticLinear (2<sup>nd</sup> order with 2 independent variables) require a minimum of 6 data pairs. This minimum requirement is for performing a regression analysis, not interpolating the tabular data. If a regression analysis is not performed (i.e., only table interpolation is used), these minimum requirements are not enforced. If a regression analysis is performed and these minimum requirements are not met, the simulation will revert to table interpolation.

<h3 id="two-independent-variable-performance-table-outputs">Two Independent Variable Performance Table Outputs</h3>
<h4 id="performance-curve-output-value_2">Performance Curve Output Value []</h4>
<p>The current value of the performance table. Performance curves and tables use the same output variable. This value is averaged over the time step being reported. Inactive or unused performance curves will show a value of -999 (e.g., equipment is off, a specific performance curve is not required for this aspect of the equipment model at this time step, etc.). This value means that the performance curve was not called during the simulation and, therefore, not evaluated. This inactive state value is only set at the beginning of each environment. When averaging over long periods of time, this inactive state value may skew results. In this case, use a detaled reporting frequency (ref. Output:Variable object) to view results at each HVAC time step.</p>
<h4 id="performance-curve-input-variable-1-value_1">Performance Curve Input Variable 1 Value []</h4>
<h4 id="performance-curve-input-variable-2-value">Performance Curve Input Variable 2 Value []</h4>

<h3 id="lookup-tables">Lookup Tables</h3>
<p>Lookup tables are useful for determining the results of a nth order polynomial without the need to calculate the polynomial coefficients. The Lagrange method for interpolation is currently the only method available for polynomial interpolation. LinearInterpolationOfTable and EvaluateCurveToLimits may also be used. The multi-variable lookup table can represent from 1 to 5 independent variables and can interpolate these independent variables up to a 4<sup>th</sup> order polynomial. The polynomial order is assumed to be the number of interpolation points (n) minus 1. Polynomial interpolation of tabular data takes place when the values of the independent variables are within the upper table boundary and at least n data points are available when approaching the lower table boundary for any independent variable. When any independent variable value is outside the table limits, linear extrapolation is used to predict the table result and is based on the two nearest data points in the table for that particular independent variable.</p>
<h3 id="tablemultivariablelookup">Table:MultiVariableLookup</h3>
<p>Input for the multi-variable data table consists of a table name, the interpolation method, the number of points to be used for interpolation, an optional external file name, and, if an external file name is not entered, the tabular data. Optional inputs for minimum and maximum values for the independent variable, and curve minimum and maximum may be used to limit the output of the table (e.g., limit extrapolation).</p>
<h4 id="field-name_207">Field: Name</h4>
<p>A unique user assigned name for an instance of a lookup table. When a table is used, it is referenced by this name. The name of this table object may be used anywhere a valid performance curve object is allowed.</p>
<h4 id="field-curve-type_2">Field: Curve Type</h4>
<p>The order of the polynomial used to represent the tabular data. Choices are <em>Linear</em>, <em>Quadratic</em>, <em>Cubic</em>, <em>Quartic, BiQuadratic, QaudraticLinear, BuCibic</em>. This field is used to determine if this table object is representative of the type of performance table (curve) allowed for a particular application (i.e., if this type of polynomial is allowed to be used as the curve type for other objects). This input also infers the polynomial order (or degree).</p>
<h4 id="field-interpolation-method_2">Field: Interpolation Method</h4>
<p>The method used to evaluate the lookup table. The choices are <em>LinearInterpolationOfTable, LagrangeInterpolationLinearExtrapolation, and EvaluateCurveToLimits</em>. . When <em>LinearInterpolationOfTable</em> is selected, the data entered is evaluated within the limits of the data set and the minimum/maximum value of x and output inputs are used only within the boundary of the table limits (i.e., are only used to limit interpolation). A complete data set is required. For each X variable, entries must include all Y variables and associated curve output (i.e., a complete table, no gaps or missing data). Extrapolation of the data set is not allowed. When <em>LagrangeInterpolationLinearExtrapolation</em> is selected, the lookup table is evaluated using Lagrange’s form of the interpolating polynomial. The order of the polynomial is inferred to be one less than the input in the Number of Interpolation Points field below. When <em>EvaluateCurveToLimits</em> is selected, the coefficients (i.e., C in the equation above) of the polynomial equation are calculated and used to determine the table output within the limits specified in the following fields (or the tabular data, whichever provide the larger range). If the minimum/maximum fields below are not entered, the limits of the data set are used. A complete table is not required when using this method, however, a minimum number of data is required to perform the regression analysis. The minimum number of data pairs required for this choice is 6 data pairs for both bi-quadratic and quadratic-linear curve types. If insufficient data is provided, the simulation reverts to interpolating the tabular data. The performance curve is written to the eio file when the output diagnotics flag DisplayAdvancedVariables is used (ref. Output:Diagnostics, DisplayAdvancedVariables). A regression analysis may only be performed on lookup tables with one or two independent variables.</p>
<h4 id="field-table-data-format">Field: Table Data Format</h4>
<p>The format specifier which determines the method used to read the lookup table. The only valid choice at this time is <em>SingleLineIndependentVariableWithMatrix</em>. When <em>SingleLineIndependentVariableWithMatrix</em> is selected, a free format is used as shown below. The format shown below assumes the output values are in ascending order for both independent variables 1 and 2. Tabular data are entered in 3 groups of data, the header, the independent variable values, and the tabular data matrix. A summary of the external file format is shown below.</p>
<p>Key:</p>
<p>IV = independent variable (i.e., the X1, or X2, etc)</p>

<h4 id="field-number-of-interpolation-points">Field: Number of Interpolation Points</h4>
<p>This field specifies the number of data points to be used in the lookup table interpolation. The value specified in this field should be 1 greater than the order (or degree) of the polynomial used for interpolation. For example, if 2 is entered here, the polynomial is assumed to be first order where only 2 data points are required to calculate the table solution. If 3 is entered here, the polynomial is assumed to be second order and 3 data points would be required to calculate the table solution. Linear extrapolation is always used when the independent variable values are near the lower edge or outside the range of the table. The interpolation points selected are always the nearest data point greater than the independent variable with 1 or more values less than the independent variable. For example, if 3 interpolation points are used, the data point greater than the independent variable and 2 data points less than the indpenedent variable are used to determine the table solution. If the independent variable exactly equals a table reference point, that value is used as the table solution.</p>
<h4 id="field-external-file-name">Field: External File Name</h4>
<p>The name of an external file that represents the tabular data. This file would include all data after the Output Unit Type field below starting with the number of independent variables and continuing until all input and output values have been entered. The tabular data may use either comma, space or tab delimited format. The field should include a full path with file name, for best results. The field must be &lt;= 100 characters.

<h3 id="data-input-format">Data Input Format</h3>
<p>The following inputs describe the data set. These values may also be placed in an external file starting with Field #1. If an external file name is entered above, the following fields are not used. Data are entered in a specific order according to the number and quantity of independent variables. The data input format is described here in 3 groups as Header, Independent Variable Values, and the Tabular Data. The header is always the first line in the data set and represents the number of independent varibles followed by the number of values for each independent variable. The independent variable values are listed next and represent the values of each independent variable on a separate line. These values are only listed once at the top of the data set and are listed in ascending order. The number of independent variables, the first number in the header, specifies how many lines, or rows, make up this section of tabular data. The remaining lines are repeated as many times as necessary to completely describe the tabular data. The values of independent variables 3 – n are listed on a single line followed by a matrix of data that represent the table output corresponding to independent variables 1 and 2.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Header:</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Line 1: The first number specified is the number of independent variables followed by the number of variables for each independent variable.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Independent Variable Values:</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Line 1: the n values for the first independent variable as specified in the header.</p>
<p>Line 2: the n values for the second independent variable as specified in the header if the number of independent variables is greater than 1. This line is not required if the number of independent variables is less than 2.</p>
<p>Line 3: the n values for the third independent variable as specified in the header if the number of independent variables is greater than 2. This line is not required if the number of independent variables is less than 3.</p>
<p>Line 4: the n values for the fourth independent variable as specified in the header if the number of independent variables is greater than 3. This line is not required if the number of independent variables is less than 4.</p>
<p>Line 5: the n values for the fifth independent variable as specified in the header if the number of independent variables is greater than 4. This line is not required if the number of independent variables is less than 5.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tabular Data:</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Line 1: the values of the 3<sup>rd</sup> through nth independent variables</p>
<p>Line 2 – m (where m-1 equals the number of variables for the second independent variable): the tabular data corresponding to the 1<sup>st</sup> independent variable (the number of inputs on this line equals the number of values for 1<sup>st</sup> independent variable), the mth values for the 2<sup>nd</sup> independent variable and corresponding to the values for the 3<sup>rd</sup> – nth independent variables (see Line 1 above for Tabular Data).</p>

<h3 id="lookup-table-outputs">Lookup Table Outputs</h3>
<h3 id="lookup-table-outputs_1">Lookup Table Outputs</h3>
<h4 id="performance-curve-output-value_3">Performance Curve Output Value []</h4>
<p>The current value of the lookup table. Performance curves and tables use the same output variable. This value is averaged over the time step being reported. Inactive or unused performance curves will show a value of -999 (e.g., equipment is off, a specific performance curve is not required for this aspect of the equipment model at this time step, etc.). This value means that the performance curve was not called during the simulation and, therefore, not evaluated. This inactive state value is only set at the beginning of each environment. When averaging over long periods of time, this inactive state value may skew results. In this case, use a detaled reporting frequency (ref. Output:Variable object) to view results at each HVAC time step.</p>
<h4 id="performance-curve-input-variable-1-n-value_1">Performance Curve Input Variable 1(-N) Value []</h4>
<p>The current value of the nth independent variable passed to the performance curve. The order of the independent variables is in the same order as the model equation represented by this performance curve object. This value is averaged over the time step being reported.</p>

<h2 id="group-fluid-properties">Group – Fluid Properties</h2>
<p>The Fluid Property routines in EnergyPlus have been designed for ease of use and to allow users to add refrigerant and glycol data to the input file without having to make any changes to the program code. Fluid properties are calculated by interpolating the tabulated data in the input file. The main input requirement is that in order to add a new fluid, a user must enter a full set of data. The user may determine the interval between data points according to the desired accuracy and range required. Data for a number of common fluids are available in the required format in a reference dataset so that the user may append this data to their input file. In addition, data for Water, Ethylene Glycol (in various concentrations from 0 to 90%), and Propylene Glycol (in various concentrations from 0 to 90%) are available as default values within EnergyPlus.</p>
<p>Each fluid is categorized as either a ‘Refrigerant’ or ‘Glycol’. Refrigerant data is further categorized as either saturated or superheated. Saturated refrigerant data is indexed, in the input data, according to pressure and temperature i.e. the specific heat, density, enthalpy in the input data are given for a given combination of pressure and temperature. Saturated refrigerant data is indexed according to pressure and quality. In the case of saturated pressure data only a temperature index is used. Glycol data is indexed in the input data according to temperature and concentration. The input data structure for each property is essentially two-dimensional (a matrix). However, since all fluid loops are assumed to be of constant concentration, EnergyPlus internally will interpolate from input data to data for the actual concentration being used in a particular loop. This reduces internally to a one-dimensional array of data for various properties where temperature is the only variable. This saves time since it reduces all interpolations for glycols to a single dimension.</p>
<p>In most cases there will be combinations of index variable (e.g. some combination of pressure and temperature) at which either no data is available, or the property data is invalid/irrelevant. For example, in the superheated refrigerant data, some combinations of temperature and pressure may correspond to a state in the saturated rather than superheated region. Similarly, in the case of glycols there may be some combinations of temperature and concentration that would correspond to the frozen state. In these cases, and where data is just not available, a zero should be present in the data at these points to indicate an invalid condition. EnergyPlus uses the presence of zeros to detect invalid conditions and give warning messages.</p>
<h3 id="fluidpropertiesname">FluidProperties:Name</h3>
<p>The names of each fluid for which property data is given in the user input have to be specified in FluidProperties:Name data objects. If data is to be included for a given fluid, either a refrigerant or a glycol, then its name must be included in the FluidProperties:Name objects.</p>
<h4 id="field-fluid-name">Field: Fluid Name</h4>
<p>Each fluid name is a unique identifier that will be used in conjunction with the data statements described later in this section. The fluid name is either referred to by a component (in the case of a Refrigerant) or by another input line (in the case of a Glycol). This list is simply a list of user defined fluids present in the input data file.</p>
<h4 id="field-fluid-type">Field: Fluid Type</h4>
<p>Each fluid name must be identified by type - either <strong>Refrigerant</strong> or <strong>Glycol</strong>. This designation determines what type of data EnergyPlus expects for the fluid name. If the fluid name is defined as a Refrigerant, the user must supply valid data for pressure, enthalpy, specific heat, and density in the saturated region and enthalpy and density in the superheated region. If the fluid name is defined as a Glycol, the user must supply valid data for specific heat, conductivity, viscosity, and density at various concentrations (percentage of non-water liquid) and temperatures.</p>
<p>An example of these statements in an input data file is:</p>
<p>FluidProperties:Name,</p>
<p>R11,Refrigerant;</p>
<p>FluidProperties:Name,</p>
<p>R12,Refrigerant;</p>
<p>FluidProperties:Name,</p>
<p>R22,Refrigerant;</p>
<p>FluidProperties:Name,</p>
<p>NH3,Refrigerant;</p>
<p>FluidProperties:Name,</p>
<p>Steam,Refrigerant;</p>
<p>FluidProperties:Name,</p>
<p>SaltBrine, Glycol;</p>
<p>FluidProperties:Name,</p>
<p>NewGlycol, Glycol;</p>
<h3 id="fluidpropertiesglycolconcentration">FluidProperties:GlycolConcentration</h3>
<p>This input syntax is used to specify fluids that will be used with HVAC loops such as plant and condenser loops. It allows the user to define a mixture of water and some other substance and the particular concentration being used. The fluid name will be referred to by the loops or components and thus used to identify which value is valid for a particular fluid at a particular temperature. A series of three inputs is requires for each fluid concentration definition.</p>
<h4 id="field-name_208">Field: Name</h4>
<p>Each glycol concentration name is a unique identifier that will be used to define a particular combination of water and some other substance (usually another fluid). Other input (such as loop definitions) will refer to this name, linking the other input to the proper fluid definition.</p>
<h4 id="field-glycol-type">Field: Glycol Type</h4>
<p>This field refers to the substance that is being mixed with water to create the glycol. The user may either select from the two default fluids (<strong>EthyleneGlycol</strong> or <strong>PropyleneGlycol</strong>) or specify <strong>UserDefinedGlycolType</strong> and use a name in the subsequent field for fluids that have been entered elsewhere in the input file. It should be noted that users must enter a complete definition of new glycols—including values for conductivity, specific heat, density, and viscosity at various concentrations and temperatures—in order for them to be used in conjunction with a user defined glycol type.</p>
<h4 id="field-user-defined-glycol-name">Field: User Defined Glycol Name</h4>
<p>This field is the name used elsewhere in a FluidProperties:Name object for defining your own glycol properties. This field is left blank unless you enter <strong>UserDefinedGlycolType</strong> in the previous field.</p>
<h4 id="field-glycol-concentration">Field: Glycol Concentration</h4>
<p>This field allows the user to specify the actual concentration of glycol being used for this particular fluid. A concentration of 0.0 refers to pure water. A concentration of 1.0 would denote 100% of the fluid referenced in the Glycol Name input discussed above. Users should enter this value as a decimal fraction since EnergyPlus will limit the range of valid input values to between 0.0 and 1.0.</p>
<p>An example of this statement in an input data file is:</p>
<p>FluidProperties:GlycolConcentration,</p>
<p>EthGly25Percent, EthyleneGlycol, ,0.25;</p>
<p>FluidProperties:GlycolConcentration,</p>
<p>ProGly40Percent, PropyleneGlycol, ,0.40;</p>
<p>FluidProperties:GlycolConcentration,</p>
<p>HalfAndHalf, UserDefinedGlycolType, NewBrine, 0.5;</p>
<h3 id="fluidpropertiestemperatures">FluidProperties:Temperatures</h3>
<p>It is assumed that all fluid properties vary with temperature. A common set of temperatures is required for each set of fluid property data. Fluid property data supplied by the user must correspondingly be given at these temperatures. Since in most cases, refrigerant data can be specified at a common set of temperatures, a single set of ‘FluidProperties:Temperatures’ can be referenced by a number of sets of property data. This provides a more compact input structure and avoids listing the temperatures multiple times. In the case of glycol data the same set of temperatures have to be used for each set of data at a given concentration. Units for the temperatures are degrees Celsius.</p>
<h4 id="field-name_209">Field: Name</h4>
<p>This field is simply an unique identifier name that is used to cross reference the list of temperatures with a specific list of fluid property data. A single temperature list can be used for more than one thermal property or fluid. For example, the same temperature list can be used for the superheated enthalpy of a refrigerant and the specific heat of a glycol if appropriate.</p>
<h4 id="fields-1-250-temperature">Field(s) 1-250: Temperature</h4>
<p>These fields (up to 250) are the temperatures at which the data for the thermal properties are to be expected. Temperatures are assumed to be in ascending order in units of Celsius.</p>
<p>An example of this statement in an input data file is:</p>
<p>FluidProperties:Temperatures,</p>
<p>R11Temperatures,</p>
<p>-70,-65,-60,-55,-50,-45,-40,-35,-30,-25,-20,-15,-10,-5,0,2,4,6,8,10,12,</p>

<p>75,80,85,90,95,100,105,110,115,120,125,130,135,140,145,150,155,160,</p>
<p>165,170,175,180,185,190,198;</p>
<h3 id="fluidpropertiessaturated">FluidProperties:Saturated</h3>
<p>Refrigerant property data for the saturated region is entered with the following syntax. For each set of property data a unique name, the type of property, phase and the corresponding list of temperatures have to be specified along with the property values.</p>
<h4 id="field-name_210">Field: Name</h4>
<p>This name identifies the fluid for which data follows in the remaining syntax. This fluid name must also be given in the fluid names list (ref: FluidProperties:Names object) as a <strong>Refrigerant</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="field-fluid-property-type">Field: Fluid Property Type</h4>
<p>This field identifies the fluid property for which data is being entered with this statement. The options for the saturated region are <strong>Enthalpy, Density, SpecificHeat</strong>, and <strong>Pressure</strong>. The units for these properties are J/kg, kg/m<sup>3</sup>, J/kg-K and Pa, respectively.</p>
<h4 id="field-fluid-phase">Field: Fluid Phase</h4>
<p>In the saturated region, each property has two values: one for the saturated liquid state and one for the saturated gaseous state. Accordingly, the phase for which the saturated property data applies is specified as either <strong>Fluid</strong> or <strong>FluidGas</strong>. Data for each phase are required and are interpolated according to quality. However, in the case of saturated pressure data values for only one phase are required (i.e. can be specified with phase specified as either Fluid or FluidGas, as this is irrelevant).</p>
<h4 id="field-temperatures-values-name">Field: Temperatures Values Name</h4>
<p>This name refers to the corresponding list of temperatures (ref: FluidProperties:Temperatures object). Each temperature in the temperature list corresponds to a data item found in the remaining fields of this syntax. The first temperature in the temperature list corresponds to the first fluid property value, the second temperature in the temperature list corresponds to the second fluid property value, etc.</p>
<h4 id="fields-1-250-property-value">Field(s) 1-250: Property Value</h4>
<p>These fields (up to 250) are the values of the thermal property specified in the fluid property type field for the phase specified in the fluid phase field. The temperature list specified in the temperature list name field links the data with the corresponding temperatures.</p>
<p>An example of this statement in an input data file is:</p>
<p>FluidProperties:Saturated,</p>
<p>R11,Enthalpy,Fluid,R11Temperatures, ! Enthalpy in J/kg</p>

<p>388850,397280,426300;</p>
<h3 id="fluidpropertiessuperheated">FluidProperties:Superheated</h3>
<p>The format of the data for the superheated region is similar to that of the saturated region but with the addition of the pressure for which each set of property values applies. A single temperature specification is required for each set of property data at a number of pressures.</p>
<h4 id="field-fluid-name_1">Field: Fluid Name</h4>
<p>This name identifies the fluid for which data follows in the remaining syntax. This fluid name must show up in the fluid names list (ref: FluidProperties:Names object) as a <strong>Refrigerant</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="field-fluid-property-type_1">Field: Fluid Property Type</h4>
<p>This field identifies the fluid property for which data is being entered with this statement. The options for the superheated region are <strong>Enthalpy</strong> and <strong>Density</strong>. The units for these properties are J/kg and kg/m<sup>3</sup>, respectively.</p>
<h4 id="field-temperatures-values-name_1">Field: Temperatures Values Name</h4>
<p>This name refers to the corresponding list of temperatures (ref: FluidProperties:Temperatures object). Each temperature in the temperature list corresponds to a given property data item at each pressure. The first temperature in the temperature list corresponds to the first fluid property value, the second temperature in the temperature list corresponds to the second fluid property value, etc.</p>
<h4 id="field-pressure">Field: Pressure</h4>
<p>In the superheated region, each fluid property is indexed according to temperature and pressure. Thus, a pressure must be listed for each set of property values. The units for pressure are Pascals (Pa). Lists of properties are various pressures and temperatures form a two-dimensional table from which EnergyPlus interpolates to find the property value at a specified temperature and pressure.</p>
<h4 id="fields-1-250-property-value_1">Field(s) 1-250: Property Value</h4>
<p>These fields (up to 250) are the values of the thermal property specified in the fluid property type field for the phase specified in the fluid phase field. The temperature list specified in the temperature list name field links the data with the corresponding temperatures.</p>
<p>An example of this statement in an input data file is:</p>
<p>FluidProperties:Superheated,</p>

<h3 id="glycol-fluid-types">Glycol Fluid Types</h3>
<p>A full data set for a glycol fluid type in EnergyPlus includes: a temperature list and lists of values for specific heat at a given concentration. Data have to be given for at least two different concentrations. The syntax lines for the property value lists are described below.</p>
<h3 id="fluidpropertiesconcentration">FluidProperties:Concentration</h3>
<p>The format of the data for the glycols is similar to that of superheated refrigerants except that data at a number of concentrations is given, rather than pressures. The concentration is listed before the rest of the data and is normalized (i.e. in the range 0.0 to 1.0, rather than a percentage). Note that glycol solutions are assumed to exist in liquid form only in EnergyPlus.</p>
<h4 id="field-fluid-name_2">Field: Fluid Name</h4>
<p>This name identifies the fluid for which data follows in the remaining syntax. This fluid name must show up in the fluid names list (ref: FluidProperties:Names object) as a <strong>Glycol</strong>.. Note that users should not use Water, EthyleneGlycol, or PropyleneGlycol as names since these are default fluids.</p>
<h4 id="field-fluid-property-type_2">Field: Fluid Property Type</h4>
<p>This field identifies the fluid property for which data is being entered with this statement. The required data for glycols includes <strong>SpecificHeat</strong> with units of J/kg-K, <strong>Density</strong> with units of kg/m<sup>3</sup>, <strong>Conductivity</strong> with units of W/m-K, and <strong>Viscosity</strong> with units of N-s/m<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<h4 id="field-temperatures-values-name_2">Field: Temperatures Values Name</h4>
<p>This name refers to the corresponding list of temperatures (ref: FluidProperties:Temperatures object). Each temperature in the temperature list corresponds to a data item found in the remaining fields of this syntax. The first temperature in the temperature list corresponds to the first fluid property value, the second temperature in the temperature list corresponds to the second fluid property value, etc.</p>
<h4 id="field-concentration">Field: Concentration</h4>
<p>A concentration must be listed for the values of specific heat that follow. Lists of properties are various concentrations and temperatures form a two-dimensional table from which EnergyPlus interpolates to find the property value at a specified temperature and concentration. Concentrations are specified in a normalized form (i.e. in the range 0.0 to 1.0, rather than a percentage)</p>
<h4 id="fields-1-250-property-value_2">Field(s) 1-250: Property Value</h4>
<p>These fields (up to 250) are the values of the thermal property specified in the fluid property type field for the phase specified in the fluid phase field. The temperature list specified in the temperature list name field links the data with the corresponding temperatures.</p>
