<p>While it is true that monthly utility bills are often directly related to monthly energy consumption and monthly peak demand, due to the elaborate regulatory environment and the changing value of the energy based on load factor, the calculations involved are often complicated. The EnergyPlus approach is to allow you to model the individual component charges that make up the utility bill and report the results on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>To show you how simple the specification of a rate can be here is a simple example for a flat charge of 8 cents for every kWh sold.</p>
<p>UtilityCost:Tariff,</p>
<p>TariffExample1,          ! Name</p>
<p>Electricity:Facility,    ! Output Meter Name</p>
<p>kWh;               ! Conversion Factor Choice</p>
<p>UtilityCost:Charge:Simple,</p>
<p>ChargeExample1,          ! Charge Variable Name</p>
<p>TariffExample1,          ! Tariff Name</p>
<p>totalEnergy,             ! Source Variable</p>
<p>Annual,                   ! Season</p>
<p>EnergyCharges,           ! Category Variable Name</p>
<p>0.08;                    ! Cost Per Unit Value or Variable Name</p>
<p>Overall, the goals of the economics section of EnergyPlus are to make simple tariffs easy to model and complex tariffs possible to model.</p>
<p>The cost implications of alternative, energy-related design options may be important in determining the whether or not a particular design is viable. Although the main purpose of EnergyPlus is to determine the energy performance of a building, component cost modeling is provided to allow estimating initial construction costs associated with the building and HVAC system being modeled. This is provided in order to ensure that cost estimates are consistent with the EnergyPlus model and it allows using results calculated during a simulation such as equipment sizes and surface areas. The cost estimating capabilities are not comprehensive and are not intended to duplicate all the types of analyses included in cost estimating software. Economics modeling is being implemented in stages. Future versions of EnergyPlus will add other investment related analyses such as life-cycle cost. The objects used by EnergyPlus for calculating first costs for construction projects are as follows:</p>

<p>The results of the cost estimate are reported in a Construction Cost Estimate Summary table provided that the user requests the results using the object Output:Table:SummaryReports object with the Component Cost Economics Summary option selected. The style of this predefined report can be controlled using the OutputControl:Table:Style object. If the Annual Building Performance Report Summary is also requested, then cost estimate results will follow that data in the same output file.</p>
<p>The rest of this Economics section is organized to first present reference material on tariff calculations followed by construction cost estimating.</p>
<h2 id="conceptual-framework-variables-and-hierarchy">Conceptual Framework – Variables and Hierarchy</h2>
<p>To understand how to use the utility bill calculation portion of EnergyPlus you first need to understand some important concepts of variables and hierarchy. A variable, for the purposes of this section, is simply a named holder of a series of numbers. In most cases, the variable will be a named holder of 12 numbers, one number for each monthly utility bill. Here is a visualization of a variable called Electric Energy Use:</p>
<p>Table 35. Example Electric Energy Use (for Economics Calculation)</p>

<p>If you have ever done any computer programming, you can think of a variable as an array. Many of the names used in the utility bill calculation portion of EnergyPlus are names of variables. In the case of the UtilityCost:Charge objects, the name of the object is also used as a name of a variable.</p>
<p>In many of today’s utility rates, the charges for energy or demand are broken into distribution and supply charges. To allow for this, more than one charge may to be defined for a particular category. The variables assigned to the same category are added together.</p>
<p>The categories are combined in following hierarchy:</p>
<p><img alt="EnergyCharge" src="../../InputOutputReference/media/image615.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 162. Hierarchy for Economics Charges</p>
<p>Any charges included in the EnergyCharges category are added together. The EnergyCharges, DemandCharges and ServiceCharges are added together to form the Basis. The Basis, Adjustments and Surcharges are added together to form the Subtotal. The Subtotal and Taxes are added together to be the Total. The total represents the total monthly charges on that tariff for the energy source used. The combining of categories together is performed automatically unless the user specifies the UtilityCost:Computation. In addition, each category, which is also a variable, may be used as a source. For example, a tax that is 5% of the subtotal would be shown as:</p>
<p>UtilityCost:Charge:Simple,</p>
<p>TaxOfFivePercent,        ! Charge Variable Name</p>
<p>TariffExample1,          ! Tariff Name</p>
<p>Subtotal,                ! Source Variable</p>
<p>Annual,                  ! Season</p>
<p>Taxes,                   ! Category Variable Name</p>
<p>0.05;                    ! Cost Per Unit Value or Variable Name</p>
<p>As you can see, the UtilityCost:Charge:Simple and UtilityCost:Charge:Block objects do most of the “work” of computing the annual energy cost. The benefit of using this categorization is that totals of each category are shown in the output reports and it organizes the charges in the monthly calculations in a logical way that fits almost all tariffs. If no categorization is desired, theoretically, all charges could be assigned to the Total category. The categories themselves are simply variable names. Charges may also be assigned to the “NotIncluded” category if the result of the charge is used as an intermediate calculation and should not be included in the Total.</p>
<p>The rest of this section is divided into a reference of the objects and the fields, a set of examples, discussion of the reporting, and a description of Complex Tariff Modeling. For most tariffs, simply using a variety of UtilityCost:Charge:Simple’s and UtilityCost:Charge:Block’s will result in a good model but for some more complex tariffs, especially ones with complex block sizes, variables may be computed using a very simple programming language that may appear in the UtilityCost:Computation object. This will be described more in the Complex Tariff Modeling section.</p>
<h2 id="utilitycosttariff">UtilityCost:Tariff</h2>
<p>Defines the name of the tariff, the type of tariff, and other details about the overall tariff. Each other object that is part of the tariff model references the tariff name including the UtilityCost:Charge:Simple, UtilityCost:Charge:Block, UtilityCost:Ratchet, UtilityCost:Qualify, UtilityCost:Variable and UtilityCost:Computation objects.</p>
<p>Multiple UtilityCost:Tariff objects can appear in the same IDF file. It is common that electric and gas utilities have more than one rate that may be used. Only one UtilityCost:Tariff for each Output:Meter object and Group Name is shown in the Economics Summary Report. The one that is shown in that report is chosen by first eliminating UtilityCost:Tariff objects that are not qualified due to their UtilityCost:Qualify objects. If more than one UtilityCost:Tariff object remains, the one that has the lowest cost for a combination of a Meter and Group Name will be selected. If the Group Name field is not used, then the lowest cost UtilityCost:Tariff is chosen for each Meter.</p>
<p>Part of the tariff description is used to transform the annual energy use of any fuel under any meter into a group of named variables containing the values for each of the periods that the bills are calculated (usually monthly). The schedules create a variable for energy use and for demand. If specified it also creates a variable for energy and a variable for demand for the “on-peak”, “off-peak”, and “shoulder” periods for use in time-of-use tariffs. It performs this allocation prior to other calculations for the tariff. The variables that are always created are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>totalEnergy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>totalDemand</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="field-name">Field: Name</h4>
<p>The name of the tariff. Tariffs are sometimes called rates. The name is used in identifying the output results and in associating all of the charges and other objects that make up a tariff.</p>
<h4 id="field-output-meter-name">Field: Output Meter Name</h4>
<p>The name of any meter defined but usually set to either Electricity:Facility or Gas:Facility.</p>
<h4 id="field-conversion-factor-choice">Field: Conversion Factor Choice</h4>
<p>A choice that allows several different predefined conversion factors to be used; otherwise, user defined conversion factors are used as defined in the next two fields.</p>
<ul>
<li>

<h4 id="field-energy-conversion-factor">Field: Energy Conversion Factor</h4>
<p>Is a multiplier used to convert energy into the units specified by the utility in their tariff. If left blank, it defaults to 1 (no conversion). This field will be used only if Conversion Factor Choice is set to UserDefined. Within EnergyPlus energy always has units of J (joules). For conversion from J to kWh use the value of 0.0000002778. This is also used for all objects that reference the UtilityCost:Tariff.</p>
<h4 id="field-demand-conversion-factor">Field: Demand Conversion Factor</h4>
<p>Is a multiplier used to convert demand into the units specified by the utility in their tariff. If left blank, it defaults to 1 (no conversion). This field will be used only if Conversion Factor Choice is set to UserDefined. Within EnergyPlus demand always has units of J/s (joules/sec) which equivalent to W (watts). For conversion from W to kW use the value of 0.001. This is also used for all objects that reference the UtilityCost:Tariff.</p>
<h4 id="field-time-of-use-period-schedule-name">Field: Time of Use Period Schedule Name</h4>
<p>The name of the schedule that defines the time-of-use periods that occur each day. The period schedule is used to determine which variables are defined. The values for the different variables are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>1 is Peak</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2 is Shoulder</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3 is OffPeak</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4 is MidPeak</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The following variables are created automatically if these different periods are used in the schedule and include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>peakEnergy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>peakDemand</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>shoulderEnergy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>shoulderDemand</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>offPeakEnergy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>offPeakDemand</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>midPeakEnergy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>midPeakDemand</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some special variables are created that include only demand from one period that exceeds the demand from another period. For other months that do not exceed, the values are zero. These variables are seldom used but are available for the occasional rate that includes a clause looking at demands during one period that exceed another period.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>PeakExceedsOffPeak</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OffPeakExceedsPeak</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PeakExceedsMidPeak</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MidPeakExceedsPeak</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PeakExceedsShoulder</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ShoulderExceedsPeak</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If no Period Schedule is specified then no peak, offPeak, midPeak or shoulder variables are defined.</p>
<h4 id="field-season-schedule-name">Field: Season Schedule Name</h4>
<p>The name of a schedule that defines the seasons. The seasons are</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>1 is Winter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2 is Spring</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3 is Summer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4 is Autumn</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The change in the season schedule must occur at the same time as the change in the Monthly Schedule. In other words, a season must end at the same time as a billing month. Variables are automatically created if a season schedule is used. These variables are set to 1 within the season and 0 for the months that are not in the season. The variables are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>isWinter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>isNotWinter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>isSpring</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>isNotSpring</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>isSummer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>isNotSummer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>isAutumn</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>isNotAutumn</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="field-month-schedule-name">Field: Month Schedule Name</h4>
<p>The name of the schedule that defines the billing periods of the year. Normally this entry is allowed to default and a schedule will be internally used that has the breaks between billing periods occurring at the same time as the breaks between months, i.e., at midnight prior to the first day of the month. If other billing periods are used such as two month cycles or a single bill for an entire season, such as some natural gas companies do in the summer, then the month schedule may be used to redefine it. Make sure that the month schedule and season schedule are consistent, otherwise an error will be issued.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>1 is the first month, usually January</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2 is the second month, usually February</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3 is the third month, usually March</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4 is the fourth month, usually April</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>5 is the fifth month, usually May</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>6 is the sixth month, usually June</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>7 is the seventh month, usually July</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>8 is the eighth month, usually August</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>9 is the ninth month, usually September</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>10 is the tenth month, usually October</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>11 is the eleventh month, usually November</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>12 is the twelfth month, usually December</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, the schedule that represents this would look like the following. If no schedule is specified the following Month Schedule is used which defines the months of the year as the normal calendar months.</p>
<p>Schedule:Compact, defaultMonths, number,</p>
<p>Through: 1/31, For: AllDays, Until: 24:00, 1,</p>
<p>Through: 2/28, For: AllDays, Until: 24:00, 2,</p>
<p>Through: 3/31, For: AllDays, Until: 24:00, 3,</p>
<p>Through: 4/30, For: AllDays, Until: 24:00, 4,</p>
<p>Through: 5/31, For: AllDays, Until: 24:00, 5,</p>
<p>Through: 6/30, For: AllDays, Until: 24:00, 6,</p>
<p>Through: 7/31, For: AllDays, Until: 24:00, 7,</p>
<p>Through: 8/31, For: AllDays, Until: 24:00, 8,</p>
<p>Through: 9/30, For: AllDays, Until: 24:00, 9,</p>
<p>Through: 10/31, For: AllDays, Until: 24:00, 10,</p>
<p>Through: 11/30, For: AllDays, Until: 24:00, 11,</p>
<p>Through: 12/31, For: AllDays, Until: 24:00, 12;</p>
<h4 id="field-demand-window-length">Field: Demand Window Length</h4>
<p>The determination of demand can vary by utility. Some utilities use the peak instantaneous demand measured but most use a fifteen minute average demand or a one hour average demand. Some gas utilities measure demand as the use during the peak day or peak week. The choices for demand window are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>QuarterHour</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HalfHour</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FullHour</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Day</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Week</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If no value is entered, QuarterHour is assumed. The choice may be overridden based on the value of Timestep so that they are consistent. If the Timestep is 6, i.e. 10 minute timesteps, then QuarterHour is not used and instead HalfHour is used instead. If Timestep is 3, i.e. 20 minute timesteps, then QuarterHour and HalfHour are not used and instead FullHour is used instead. Day and Week are primarily used by fuel utilities.</p>
<h4 id="field-monthly-charge-or-variable-name">Field: Monthly Charge or Variable Name</h4>
<p>The fixed monthly service charge that many utilities have. The entry may be numeric and gets added to the ServiceCharges variable or if a variable name is entered here, its values for each month are used.</p>
<h4 id="field-minimum-monthly-charge-or-variable-name">Field: Minimum Monthly Charge or Variable Name</h4>
<p>The minimum total charge for the tariff or if a variable name is entered here, its values for each month are used.  The sum of the subtotal and taxes usually equals the total unless you have specified the minimum monthly charge. If the minimum monthly charge does not apply to the entire bill, a UtilityCost:Computation object can be specified using a Minimum function for the appropriate variables.</p>
<h4 id="field-real-time-pricing-charge-schedule-name">Field: Real Time Pricing Charge Schedule Name</h4>
<p>Used with real time pricing rates. The name of a schedule that contains the cost of energy for that particular time period of the year. Real time rates can be modeled using a charge schedule with the actual real time prices entered in the schedule. The charges should be consistent with the conversion factor specified in the tariff.</p>
<h4 id="field-customer-baseline-load-schedule-name">Field: Customer Baseline Load Schedule Name</h4>
<p>Used with real time pricing rates and often described as the CBL or customer baseline load. The name of a schedule that contains the baseline energy use for the customer. Many real time rates apply the charges as a credit or debit only to the difference between the baseline use and the actual use. The baseline use is established between the customer and the utility using a contract. If this field is used the baseline use schedule will be used for establishing the totalEnergy and totalDemand instead of the metered value and the real time rate charge is added or subtracted to the rate calculation using the real time charge schedule. If this field is not used, the real time charge schedule applies to all energy from the meter and totalEnergy and totalDemand is based on metered value as usual.</p>
<h4 id="field-group-name">Field: Group Name</h4>
<p>The group name of the tariff such as distribution, transmission, supplier, etc. If more than one tariff with the same group name is present and qualifies, only the lowest cost tariff is used. Usually the group name field is left blank which results in all tariffs using the same meter variable being compared and the lowest cost one being selected.</p>
<h4 id="field-buy-or-sell">Field: Buy Or Sell</h4>
<p>Sets whether the tariff is used for buying, selling or both to the utility. This should be allowed to default to BuyFromUtility unless a power generation system is included in the building that may generate more power than the building needs during the year. The choices are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>BuyFromUtility – The values from the metered variable are used and are shown as being purchases from the utility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SellToUtility – The values from the metered variable are used for a “sell back” rate to the utility. The charges in the rate should be expressed as negative values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NetMetering – Negative values are used to reduce any positive values during the specific period on the tariff when negative values occur.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A warning will be issued if the selection of this field does not match the type of meter.</p>
<h2 id="utilitycostqualify">UtilityCost:Qualify</h2>
<p>Many utilities provide a large number of tariffs and separate their customers by the amount of energy use they have or by the amount of demand. The qualify object allows only certain tariffs that are modeled to be used. If the results of the simulation fall outside of the range of qualifications, that tariff is still calculated but the “Qualified” entry will say “No” and the UtilityCost:Qualify that caused its exclusion is shown. When multiple tariffs from the same utility are modeled and only one of them should be used, make sure that the qualifiers are consistent especially within the same GroupName (see UtilityCost:Tariff). Multiple UtilityCost:Qualify objects can appear for a specific rate and they can be based on any variable.</p>
<p>The energy used and demands for each month vary. Since it is possible that they vary across the minimum and maximum values defined by this object, a choice in how to treat the thresholds is necessary. Say that a utility has two tariffs, a small tariff that has a maximum demand requirement of 50kW and a large tariff that has a minimum demand requirement of 50kW. If the use for a building goes above the 50kW threshold during some summer months and the rest of the time is below 50kW, then how does the utility choose which rate would qualify. The utility probably has very specific requirements about which months or consecutive months can be above or below a threshold to qualify for the rate.</p>
<h4 id="field-name_1">Field: Name</h4>
<p>The name used for the UtilityCost:Qualify and displayed if the tariff does not qualify. It is also treated as a variable and contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>1 for each month that does qualify,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>0 for months that do not qualify, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>-1 for months that are not part of the season selected.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="field-tariff-name">Field: Tariff Name</h4>
<p>The name of the UtilityCost:Tariff object that is associated with this UtilityCost:Qualify object.</p>
<h4 id="field-variable-name">Field: Variable Name</h4>
<p>The name of the variable used. For energy and demand, the automatically created variables, totalEnergy and totalDemand should be used, respectively.</p>
<h4 id="field-qualify-type">Field: Qualify Type</h4>
<p>Enter either “Minimum” or “Maximum”.</p>
<h4 id="field-threshold-value-or-variable-name">Field: Threshold Value or Variable Name</h4>
<p>The minimum or maximum value for the qualify. If the variable has values that are less than this value when the qualify type is minimum then the tariff may be disqualified. If the variable has values that are greater than this value when the qualify type is maximum then the tariff may be disqualified. For demand, it is still the minimum of the demands set each month even though the demands are, by definition, the peak value for the month. Depending on the threshold test entry (see below) this minimum applies to all months, some of the months, or just a single month.</p>
<h4 id="field-season">Field: Season</h4>
<p>If the UtilityCost:Qualify only applies to a season, enter the season name from the following list:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Annual</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Winter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spring</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Summer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fall</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If this field is left blank, it defaults to Annual.</p>
<h4 id="field-threshold-test">Field: Threshold Test</h4>
<p>Enter either “Count” or “Consecutive”. Uses the number in Number of Months in one of two different ways depending on the Threshold Test. If the Threshold Test is set to “Count” then the qualification is based on the count of the total number of months per year. If the Threshold Test is set to “Consecutive” then the qualification is based on a consecutive number of months. If left blank this field defaults to count and it should be allowed to default for most cases.</p>
<h4 id="field-number-of-months">Field: Number of Months</h4>
<p>A number from 1 to 12. If no value entered, 12 is assumed when the qualify type is minimum and 1 when the qualify type is maximum. This is the number of months that the threshold test applies to determine if the rate qualifies or not. If the season is less than 12 months (if it is not annual) then the value is automatically reduced to the number of months of the season.</p>
<h2 id="utilitycostchargesimple">UtilityCost:Charge:Simple</h2>
<p>The UtilityCost:Charge:Simple is one of the most often used objects for tariff calculation. It is used to compute energy and demand charges that are very simple. It may also be used for taxes, surcharges and any other charges that occur on a utility bill. As many UtilityCost:Charge:Simple objects as needed may be defined for a single tariff and they will be added together.</p>
<h4 id="field-charge-variable-name">Field: Charge Variable Name</h4>
<p>This is the name associated with the UtilityCost:Charge:Simple object and will appear in the report. In addition, the results of the UtilityCost:Charge:Simple calculation are stored in a variable with the same name. That way, the results may be used for further calculation. Spaces are not significant in Charge Variable Names. They are removed during the utility bill calculation process.</p>
<h4 id="field-tariff-name_1">Field: Tariff Name</h4>
<p>The name of the tariff that this UtilityCost:Charge:Simple is associated with.</p>
<h4 id="field-source-variable">Field: Source Variable</h4>
<p>The name of the source used by the UtilityCost:Charge:Simple. This is usually the name of the variable holding the energy or demand but may also be the name of any variable including the subtotal or basis if other charges are based on those.</p>
<h4 id="field-season_1">Field: Season</h4>
<p>This is the name (or number) of a season for which the UtilityCost:Charge:Simple is calculated. If this is set to Annual, the calculations are performed for the UtilityCost:Charge:Simple for the entire year (all months) otherwise it is calculated only for those months in the season defined. The season is defined by the Season Schedule in the UtilityCost:Tariff object. The choices for seasons are the following names or numbers may be used:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Annual</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Winter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spring</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Summer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fall</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="field-category-variable-name">Field: Category Variable Name</h4>
<p>All charges get added somewhere in the hierarchy described in the introduction to EnergyPlus economics above. This field shows where the charge should be added. The reason to enter this field appropriately is so that the charge gets reported in a reasonable category. The charge automatically gets added to the variable that is the category. The choices for this field are limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>EnergyCharges</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DemandCharges</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ServiceCharges</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Basis</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adjustment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Surcharge</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subtotal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Taxes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Total</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NotIncluded</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="field-cost-per-unit-value-or-variable-name">Field: Cost per Unit Value or Variable Name</h4>
<p>This field contains either a single number or the name of a variable. The number is multiplied with all of the energy or demand or other source that is specified in the source field. If a variable is used, then the monthly values of the variable are multiplied against the variable specified in the source field. This field makes it easy to include a simple charge without specifying block sizes. It is added to any of the block calculations (see later fields) but is most often used by itself. If no value or variable is entered, a zero is assumed. This is a good way to include a tax or cost adjustment. For SellToUtility tariffs, the values in this field are usually expressed as negative numbers.</p>
<h2 id="utilitycostchargeblock">UtilityCost:Charge:Block</h2>
<p>The UtilityCost:Charge:Block objects is also used extensively for tariff calculation. It is used to compute energy and demand charges that are structured in blocks of charges. It may also be used for taxes, surcharges and any other charges that occur on a utility bill but those are more commonly simple flat charges so UtilityCost:Charge:Simple  is more commonly used for those functions. As many UtilityCost:Charge:Block objects as needed may be defined for a single tariff and they will be added together. Blocks are a structure used by almost all utilities for calculating energy and demand charges and they allow the utility to charge more or less per unit of energy or demand if more units are used.</p>
<h4 id="field-charge-variable-name_1">Field: Charge Variable Name</h4>
<p>This is the name associated with the UtilityCost:Charge:Block object and will appear in the report. In addition, the results of the UtilityCost:Charge:Block are stored in a variable with the same name. That way, the results may be used for further calculation.</p>
<h4 id="field-tariff-name_2">Field: Tariff Name</h4>
<p>The name of the tariff that this UtilityCost:Charge:Block is associated with.</p>
<h4 id="field-source-variable_1">Field: Source Variable</h4>
<p>The name of the source used by the UtilityCost:Charge:Block. This is usually the name of the variable holding the energy or demand but may also be the name of any variable including the subtotal or basis if other charges are based on those.</p>
<h4 id="field-season_2">Field: Season</h4>
<p>This is the name (or number) of a season for which the  UtilityCost:Charge:Block is calculated. If this is set to annual, the calculations are performed for the UtilityCost:Charge:Block for the entire year (all months) otherwise it is calculated only for those months in the season defined. The season is defined by the Season Schedule in the UtilityCost:Tariff object. The choices for seasons are the following names or numbers may be used:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Annual</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Summer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Winter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spring</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fall</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="field-category-variable-name_1">Field: Category Variable Name</h4>
<p>All charges get added somewhere in the hierarchy described in the introduction to EnergyPlus economics above. This field shows where the charge should be added. The reason to enter this field appropriately is so that the charge gets reported in a reasonable category. The charge automatically gets added to the variable that is the category. The choices for this field are limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>EnergyCharges</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DemandCharges</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ServiceCharges</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Basis</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adjustment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Surcharge</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subtotal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Taxes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Total</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NotIncluded</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="field-remaining-into-variable">Field: Remaining Into Variable</h4>
<p>If the blocks do not use all of the energy or demand from the source, some energy and demand remains, then the remaining amount should be assigned to a variable. If no variable is assigned and some amount of energy or demand is not used in the block structure a warning will be issued.</p>
<h4 id="field-block-size-multiplier-value-or-variable-name">Field: Block Size Multiplier Value or Variable Name</h4>
<p>The sizes of the blocks are usually used directly but if a value or a variable is entered here, the block sizes entered in the rest of the charge are first multiplied by the entered value prior to being used. This is common for rates that are kWh/kW rates and in that case the variable that holds the monthly total electric demand would be entered. If no value is entered, a default value of one is assumed so that the block sizes remain exactly as entered. This field is unusual for the EnergyPlus syntax because it can be either a number or a name of a variable.</p>
<h4 id="field-block-size-1-value-or-variable-name">Field: Block Size 1 Value or Variable Name</h4>
<p>The size of the first block of the charges is entered here. For most rates that use multiple blocks, this will be the value for the first block size. Additional block sizes are entered with every other field. A default variable named “remaining” contains a large value and this may be used when the remaining amount should be included in that block. This field and the next field may be repeated in groups of two for as many blocks as are defined. This field is unusual for the EnergyPlus syntax because it can be either a number or a name of a variable.</p>
<h4 id="field-block-1-cost-per-unit-value-or-variable-name">Field: Block 1 Cost per Unit Value or Variable Name</h4>
<p>The cost of the first block. This value is also repeated for every other field in the charge. As many blocks may be entered as are needed. This field and the previous field may be repeated in groups of two for as many blocks as are defined. This field is unusual for the EnergyPlus syntax because it can be either a number or a name of a variable. For SellToUtility tariffs, the values in this field are usually expressed as negative numbers.</p>
<p>These last two fields may be repeated fifteen times. If more blocks are defined by the utility, the computation can be continued using another UtilityCost:Charge:Block and using the variable from Remaining Into Variable as the source variable.</p>
<h2 id="utilitycostratchet">UtilityCost:Ratchet</h2>
<p>The UtilityCost:Ratchet command allows the modeling of tariffs that include some type of seasonal ratcheting. Ratchets are most common when used with electric demand charges. A ratchet is when a utility requires that the demand charge for a month with a low demand may be increased to be more consistent with a month that set a higher demand charge.</p>
<p>While the details of the UtilityCost:Ratchet command are described further in this section, an example is probably the easiest way to learn the basic functions.</p>
<p>Ratchet Example: A utility has a single ratchet that says that the billing demand for each month of the year is the higher value of the actual demand or 60% of the peak summer demand</p>
<p>UtilityCost:Ratchet,</p>
<p>BillingDemand1,   ! Ratchet Variable Name</p>
<p>ExampleTariff1,   ! Tariff Name</p>
<p>TotalDemand,      ! Baseline Source Variable</p>
<p>TotalDemand,      ! Adjustment Source Variable</p>
<p>Summer,           ! Season From</p>
<p>Annual,           ! Season To</p>
<p>0.60,             ! Multiplier Value or Variable Name</p>
<p>0;                ! Offset Value or Variable Name</p>
<p>The Ratchet Variable Name (the first field) should be used wherever the ratchet should be applied and is often the source variable for UtilityCost:Charge:Simple or UtilityCost:Charge:Block.</p>
<p>The detailed steps taken for the ratchet are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>AdjSeasonal contains either:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When SeasonFrom is not set to Monthly, the maximum for all months in Season From in the Adjustment Source Variable. This is a single value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When SeasonFrom is set to Monthly, the monthly values of the Adjustment Source Variable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AdjPeak = (AdjSeasonal + Offset) * Multiplier</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MaxAdjBase = maximum value of either AdjPeak or Baseline Source Variable</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The resulting Ratchet Variable contains:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For months not in SeasonTo, the values of Baseline Source Variable</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For months in SeasonTo, the values of MaxAdjBase</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If multiple ratchets occur in the same tariff, multiple UtilityCost:Ratchet commands should be “chained” together with the Baseline Source Variable subsequent ratchets referencing the Ratchet Variable Name of the previous UtilityCost:Ratchet.</p>
<p>Since the ratchet command can add together two variables, mutliply two variables, or take the maximum value between two variables, it may be used for other difficult to model tariffs without needing to use UtilityCost:Computation. Clever use of UtilityCost:Ratchet should be well documented with comments.</p>
<h4 id="field-ratchet-variable-name">Field: Ratchet Variable Name</h4>
<p>The name of the ratchet and the name of the result of this single ratchet.</p>
<h4 id="field-tariff-name_3">Field: Tariff Name</h4>
<p>The name of the tariff that this UtilityCost:Ratchet is associated with.</p>
<h4 id="field-baseline-source-variable">Field: Baseline Source Variable</h4>
<p>The name of the variable used as the baseline value. When the ratcheted value exceeds the baseline value for a month the ratcheted value is used but when the baseline value is greater then the ratcheted value the baseline value is used. Usually the electric demand charge is used. The baseline source variable can be the results of another ratchet object. This allows utility tariffs that have multiple ratchets to be modeled.</p>
<h4 id="field-adjustment-source-variable">Field: Adjustment Source Variable</h4>
<p>The variable that the ratchet is calculated from. It is often but not always the same as the baseline source variable. The ratcheting calculations using offset and multiplier are using the values from the adjustment source variable. If left blank, the adjustment source variable is the same as the baseline source variable.</p>
<h4 id="field-season-from">Field: Season From</h4>
<p>The name of the season that is being examined. The maximum value for all of the months in the named season is what is used with the multiplier and offset. This is most commonly Summer or Annual. When Monthly is used, the adjustment source variable is used directly for all months.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Annual</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Winter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spring</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Summer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fall</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monthly</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="field-season-to">Field: Season To</h4>
<p>The name of the season when the ratchet would be calculated. This is most commonly Winter. The ratchet only is applied to the months in the named season. The resulting variable for months not in the Season To selection will contain the values as appear in the baseline source variable.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Annual</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Winter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spring</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Summer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fall</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="field-multiplier-value-or-variable-name">Field: Multiplier Value or Variable Name</h4>
<p>Often the ratchet has a clause such as “the current month demand or 90% of the summer month demand”. For this case a value of 0.9 would be entered here as the multiplier. This value may be left blank if no multiplier is needed and a value of one will be used as a default.</p>
<h4 id="field-offset-value-or-variable-name">Field: Offset Value or Variable Name</h4>
<p>A less common strategy is to say that the ratchet must be all demand greater than a value, in this case an offset that is added to the demand may be entered here. If entered, it is common for the offset value to be negative representing that the demand be reduced.  If no value is entered it is assumed to be zero and not affect the ratchet.</p>
<h2 id="utilitycostvariable">UtilityCost:Variable</h2>
<p>The UtilityCost:Variable object allows for the direct entry of monthly values into a variable.</p>
<h4 id="field-name_2">Field: Name</h4>
<p>The name of the variable.</p>
<h4 id="field-tariff-name_4">Field: Tariff Name</h4>
<p>The name of the tariff that is using the variable.</p>
<h4 id="field-variable-type">Field: Variable Type</h4>
<p>This field is used to indicate the kind of units that may be associated with the variable. It is used by IDF Editor to display the appropriate SI and IP units for the January through December values. The available options are shown below. If none of these options are appropriate, select <strong>Dimensionless</strong> which will have no unit conversion<strong>.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Energy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Demand</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Currency</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dimensionless</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="field-january-through-december-values">Field: January through December Values</h4>
<p>An entry (up to 24 are available) of the monthly values of the variable. Normally 12 months are used for most utility rates and so 12 values should be entered. If any values are not entered, the value of the previous entry is used. This allows a variable that is constant for an entire year to be entered using only the first value.</p>
<h2 id="utilitycostcomputation">UtilityCost:Computation</h2>
<p>The UtilityCost:Computation object lists a series of computations that are used to perform the bill calculation. The object is only used for complex tariffs that cannot be modeled any other way. For 95% of the utility tariffs, using UtilityCost:Computation is unnecessary and should be avoided. If the UtilityCost:Computation object is used, it must contain references to all objects involved in the rate in the order that they should be computed.</p>
<h4 id="field-name_3">Field: Name</h4>
<p>The name of the UtilityCost:Computation.</p>
<h4 id="field-tariff-name_5">Field: Tariff Name</h4>
<p>The name of the tariff that this UtilityCost:Charge:Simple is associated with.</p>
<h4 id="field-compute-step-n">Field: Compute Step N</h4>
<p>The Compute Step fields contain a simple language that describes the steps used in the computation process similar to a programming language. If no entry is made to any Compute Step fields (as usually the case) a default method of computing the rates shall be used. Compute Step is described later in this section under Complex Tariff Modeling.</p>
<p>Remember, this object should be omitted for almost all tariffs.</p>
<h2 id="utilitycosttariff-examples">UtilityCost:Tariff Examples</h2>
<p>One of the best ways to learn the details of EnergyPlus Economics is to see some example tariffs and how they translate into objects. To do this, several different rates of increasing complexity are shown in the following examples.</p>
<p>Another source of examples is the large set of tariff input objects provided with EnergyPlus in the macro data set file called “UtilityTariffObjects.imf” located in the “MacroDataSets” folder where EnergyPlus is installed. This file contains sets of objects that fully define tariffs for commercial customers from a collection of U.S. utility companies.</p>
<h4 id="example-a-flat-energy-charge">Example A – Flat Energy Charge</h4>
<p>As an example of the simplest type of tariff.</p>
<p>Customer Charge: $2.51 per month</p>
<p>Energy Charge:    5.5342 cents/kWh</p>
<p>This tariff would use a single UtilityCost:Charge:Simple object. The monthly charge is part of the UtilityCost:Tariff object.</p>

<h4 id="example-b-block-energy-charge">Example B – Block Energy Charge</h4>
<p>Another simple type of tariff is one where the energy charges vary by the amount of energy consumed each month.</p>
<p>Customer Charge:    $5.75 per month</p>
<p>Energy Charge:        7.231 cents/kWh for first 200 kWh</p>
<p>6.656 cents/kWh for next 1000 kWh</p>
<p>5.876 cents/kWh for over 1200 kWh</p>
<p>This tariff would use a single UtilityCost:Charge:Block object. The monthly charge is part of the UtilityCost:Tariff object. Note that the block sizes are every other field at the bottom of the object and the that final block size references a built in variable called “remaining” that contains a very large number.</p>

<h4 id="example-c-block-energy-and-demand-charges">Example C – Block Energy and Demand Charges</h4>
<p>This example contains both a block for energy and a block for demand and is very similar to the previous example except it now includes demand charges as well. The energy and demand charges vary by the amount of energy and demand consumed each month.</p>
<p>Energy Charge:        4.74 cents/kWh for first 20,000 kWh</p>
<p>4.24 cents/kWh for next 180,000 kWh</p>
<p>3.83 cents/kWh for additional kWh</p>
<p>Demand Charge:      5.38 dollars per kW for first 20 kW</p>
<p>4.23 dollars per kW for next 80 kW</p>
<p>3.60 dollars per kW for additional kW</p>
<p>This tariff would use two UtilityCost:Charge:Block objects. No monthly charge is shown so the UtilityCost:Tariff object can include just the first four fields.

<h4 id="example-e-kwhkw-energy-charges">Example E – kWh/kW Energy Charges</h4>
<p>A more advanced rate varies the size of the blocks based on amount of demand for the month. This creates an effective demand charge if the blocks have declining values.</p>

<h4 id="example-g-blocks-within-blocks">Example G – Blocks within Blocks</h4>
<p>Utilities have come up with many different ways to encourage certain load factors and discourage other load factors. One method that has been used is blocks defined within other blocks. In the following example standard kWh blocks exist within the energy allocated for the first of several kWh/kW blocks.</p>
<p>Monthly Charge:   $35 per month</p>
<p>Energy Charge:    For all consumption not greater than 200 hours times the demand use</p>
<p>10.32 cents/kWh for the first 1000 kWh</p>
<p>7.43 cents/kWh for the next 4000 kWh</p>
<p>6.23 cents/kWh for the next 5000 kWh</p>
<p>4.27 cents/kWh for the remaining kWh less than 200 hours times the demand</p>
<p>6.82 cents/kWh for all consumption in excess of 200 hours and not greater than 400 hours times the demand</p>
<p>5.03 cents/kWh for all consumption in excess of 400 hours times the demand.</p>
<p>To set up this “block within a block” a UtilityCost:Charge:Block is first used to separate out the first 200 kWh/kW. The “EnergyFirst200kWhPerkW” charge performs this. It uses demand to multiply the first block size by 200 and the “cost” for the block is simply 1 since it passes through the energy to the variable “EnergyFirst200kWhPerkW”. The remaining energy goes into the “restOfEnergy” variable as specified as the “Remaining Into Variable” field. After this is evaluated we have two new variables that hold energy. Each of these variables are then separately used in UtilityCost:Charge:Block objects to evaluate the different parts of the example tariff. By using the “Remaining Into Variable” along with the concept of variables, many very complex tariffs may be modeled.</p>

<h4 id="example-h-real-time-pricing">Example H – Real Time Pricing</h4>
<p>Some utilities have tariffs that can have different prices every hour of the year called Real Time Pricing tariffs. Often the utility will inform the customer of the prices for each hour of the day just one day in advance. To model this type of utility rate a normal schedule is used that contains the prices on an hourly basis.  The “Charge Schedule” field is where the Schedule object containing the prices is referenced.  In addition, the “Baseline Use Schedule” field is used to set the schedule for the customer baseline load. Not all utilities use a customer baseline load so the field can be left blank if none is needed. The Period, Season and Month Schedules are not needed for these tariffs unless UtilityCost:Charge’s are used.  The Schedule:File object can be especially useful to input a complex schedule that changes throughout the year.</p>
<p>Example H, shown below, is an example of how to use the UtilityCost:Tariff object with a schedule to calculate a utility tariff using real time prices.  The example real time pricing schedule results in the same energy cost as Example F – Seasonal Time of Use Energy. This is only an example and usually for real time pricing the schedule values would vary throughout the year.</p>

<h4 id="example-i-selling-and-net-metering">Example I – Selling and Net-Metering</h4>
<p>When the building contains a generator, photovoltaics, or other sources of electrical power, there is an opportunity for the building generator to produce more power than the building uses. The excess power can either be sold to the utility or offset the energy purchased.</p>
<p>When the excess power is sold, two utility rates need to be defined. The first can be defined just as in any of the previous examples. Since the “Buy or Sell” field of the UtilityCost:Tariff object defaults to “buyFromUtility” it does not even need to be specified. The meter specified in the “Output Meter” is usually set to “ElectricityPurchased:Facility.”</p>
<p>The second tariff needs to be defined with the “Buy or Sell” field set to “sellToUtility.” The “Output Meter” is usually set to “ElectricitySurplusSold:Facility.” It is important to set the appropriate meters that correspond with the “Buy or Sell” field.  The example below shows an tariff that sells the excess electricity back to utility. The UtilityCost:Charge:Simple object contains a “Cost Per Value” with a negative number. A negative number is critical if a credit for selling this electricity is expected.</p>

<p>The next part of this example is a rate that uses net-metering. With net metering the meter conceptually turns backwards when the energy is being sold to the utility directly reducing the energy consumption being charged.  Effectively, the rate charge for purchased electricity is the same as the rate credited for electricity sold to the utility. In this the “Buy or Sell” field should be set to “netMetering.”  It is also important the “Output Meter” is set to a meter that represents net metering such as “ElectricityNet:Facility.” The following example shows a simple example tariff using net metering with a single UtilityCost:Charge:Simple:</p>

<h2 id="complex-tariff-modeling">Complex Tariff Modeling</h2>
<p>Much can be accomplished with the UtilityCost:Charge:Simple and UtilityCost:Charge:Block objects. In almost all cases, these structures are flexible enough to model the tariff. At times the built in approach is not sufficient to model a particular rate. In those cases, the rate may be modeled by using the UtilityCost:Computation object. For most rates this object can be omitted but for difficult to model rates, they may be used to modify the normal way the rate computation is performed.</p>
<p>Each ComputeStep is performed in order and can be either a variable followed by an expression or simply a variable.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>demandMod SUM demand1 demand2</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>chargeSummer1</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The normal calculations associated with the UtilityCost:Qualify, UtilityCost:Charge:Simple, UtilityCost:Charge:Block, or UtilityCost:Ratchet are performed the first time that object is called. Subsequent times are not recomputed but use the value stored in the appropriate variable. The result of the computation for those objects is available in the expression for further computation. The expressions allow the manipulation of variables directly using simple mathematical functions. Only variable names may be entered along with operators. Numbers may not be entered and should be entered with UtilityCost:Variable. Multiple operators are allowed per step. Variables names do not include spaces. If spaces are found in a variable name then an error is shown. Unused variables are flagged with a warning. All expressions are in the form:</p>
<ul>
<li>assignedToVariable OPERATOR variable1 variable2</li>
</ul>
<p>Each step is performed for each of the months before the next step is taken. The same operation is performed for each step as specified.</p>
<p>The actual evaluation of the expression is performed from the end of the line to the beginning using stack based operations. Some operators pull all values from the stack (SUM, MAXIMUM, MINIMUM) while most use just one or two values from the stack. All operations return a single value to the stack. This stack based approach to expressions is sometimes called Polish Notation. While multiple operators are allowed per line, it reduces confusion if each line has only a single operator.</p>
<p>When the UtilityCost:Computation object is used, it must contain references to all objects involved in the rate in the order that they should be computed. No checking is performed for objects that should or should not be included; instead, the computational process is driven completely by the input of this object.</p>
<p>A typical rate will have a simple series of steps. For example F the following steps would be created automatically by the software:</p>
<p>UtilityCost:Computation,</p>
<p>SpecialStepsForF,             !- Name</p>
<p>ExampleF,                     !- Tariff Name</p>

<p>SubTotal SUM Basis Adjustments Surcharges, Compute Step 3</p>
<p>Total SUM SubTotal Taxes, Compute Step 4</p>
<p>MinDemand; Compute Step 5</p>
<p>This example does not have any dependency of different charges that are summed on the same line but if it did the charges could appear by themselves on lines and this would indicate the order that they should be computed. Here is the same example again showing that form.</p>

<h2 id="cost-estimating">Cost Estimating</h2>
<p>In order to understand how to include cost estimates, it may be helpful to first define some terminology and provide an overview of the process used in EnergyPlus. There are three broad steps involved. The first involves determining <em>construction</em> costs by summing individual “line items.”  The second involves determining <em>project</em> costs by adjusting construction costs to account for things like profit and design fees. The third involves comparing the current simulation to a reference case so that marginal increases can be calculated. Each of these steps involves using one of the three ‘ComponentCost’ objects described below.</p>
<h3 id="componentcostlineitem">ComponentCost:LineItem</h3>
<p>Each instance of this object creates a cost line item and will contribute to the total for a cost estimate. Each line item is reported in table form in the tabular report file. The user must request that this report be generated by including a Output:Table:SummaryReports object with the Component Cost Economics Summary option selected. The style of a tabular report can be controlled using the OutputControl:Table:Style object.</p>
<p>Cost estimates are not currently general in that they cannot be performed for every type of component that could be included in an EnergyPlus model. Although a “General” option is available where all information needed for the cost line item is input by the user, the usefulness of cost modeling within EnergyPlus is expected to be enhanced when quantities are obtained from elsewhere in the input file or computed during a simulation. The cost computations are programmed in selected ways for selected objects. The objects available and the type of cost modeling that may be performed are discussed in detail in the discussion of Reference Object Type field. A particular instance of this object will always have many blank fields. Entering values in too many fields may cause an error because the program may determine how a particular cost is to be calculated based on the presence of non-zero values in particular fields. The input object includes fields that are reserved for future use in expanded cost estimate and investment analyses planned for future versions of EnergyPlus. If you would like to request additional objects or different methods of modeling component costs, feel free to describe your needs and submit a request via email to energyplus-support@gard.com.</p>
<h4 id="field-name_4">Field: Name</h4>
<p>This field is a user-selected name that will appear in the line item description of the cost report. It is not used in the calculation but allows identifying a line item in the subsequent report.</p>
<h4 id="field-type">Field: Type</h4>
<p>This field is not yet used and may be left blank.</p>
<h4 id="field-line-item-type">Field: Line Item Type</h4>
<p>The cost estimate line item calculation will be controlled by the name entered in this field. The requirements for the remaining input, and the cost calculations performed, will vary depending on the object referenced here. Only selected objects can be entered here. The objects available for cost estimating are listed in the following table showing the active fields and options available for each.</p>

<p>General</p>
<p>This choice of object is used to calculate costs in a general way. No quantities from internal calculations are used. All information needed for the cost line item is input by the user. The Cost per Each and the Quantity fields that follow need to have values.</p>
<h5 id="construction">Construction</h5>
<p>This choice of object type is used to calculate the costs associated with surfaces based on the type of Construction used for the surface. Costs are entered on a per-square-meter basis. The program finds all the surfaces that have the type of Construction named in the Reference Object Name field that follows and determines the total area. If the model includes duplicate surfaces, as for interior partitions or floors, these will be detected and not double-counted. The cost per area should include all the material layers defined in the Construction.</p>
<h5 id="coildx-or-coilcoolingdxsinglespeed">Coil:DX or Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed</h5>
<p>This choice of object type is used to calculate the cost of direct expansion cooling equipment. Cost can be entered in three different ways, (1) per each, (2) per kW total cooling capacity, or (3) per kW total cooling capacity per COP (coefficient of performance). The program will determine which method to use by examining which input fields have non-zero values. It is an error to specify costs in more than one way. The per-each approach is most useful for discrete packages. The per-kW approach is useful for autosizing DX coils with the same COP. The per-kW-per-COP approach is convenient for modeling autosized DX coils with differing COPs as long as a linear relationship is sufficient.</p>
<p>The wildcard character “*” may be used in the object name field that follows to allow a single line item to include all of the DX coils in the model.</p>
<p>Chiller:Electric</p>
<p>This choice of object type is used to calculate the cost of a central chiller. The object name entered in following field must correspond to a Chiller:Electric object name defined elsewhere in the input file. Cost can be entered in three different ways, (1) per each, (2) per kW total cooling capacity or (3) per kW total cooling capacity per COP (coefficient of performance). The program will determine which method to use by examining which input fields have non-zero values. It is an error to specify costs in more than one way. The per-each approach is most useful for discrete chillers. The per-kW approach is useful for autosizing chillers with the same COP. The per-kW-per-COP approach is convenient for modeling autosized chillers with differing COPs as long as a linear relationship is sufficient.</p>
<h5 id="coilheatinggas">Coil:Heating:Gas</h5>
<p>This choice of object type is used to calculate the cost of gas-fired heating equipment. Cost can be entered in three different ways, (1) per each, (2) per kW of heating capacity, or (3) per kW total cooling capacity per nominal efficiency (actually uses the per kW per COP field). The program will determine which method to use by examining which input fields have non-zero values. It is an error to specify costs in more than one way. The per-each approach is most useful for discrete packages. The per-kW approach is useful for autosizing heating coils with the same efficiency. The per-kW-per-Eff approach is convenient for modeling autosized heating coils with differing efficiencies as long as a linear relationship is sufficient.</p>
<p>The wildcard character “*” may be used in the object name field that follows to allow a single line item to include all of the gas heating coils in the model.</p>
<h5 id="daylightingcontrols">Daylighting:Controls</h5>
<p>These choices of object type are used to include the cost of controllers needed to control electric lighting in response to daylight. The only option for entering costs is “per each”. The wildcard character “*” may be used in the following object name field to allow a single line item to include all of the simple and detailed daylighting controls in the cost model.</p>
<h5 id="shadingzonedetailed">Shading:Zone:Detailed</h5>
<p>This choice of object type is used to calculate the costs associated with attached shading surfaces. Costs are entered on a per-square-meter basis. The cost calculations are similar to those for heat transfer surfaces but are handled separately because “Construction” is not defined for a shading surface. The object name entered in the following field must correspond to a Shading:Zone:Detailed object name defined elsewhere in the input file.</p>
<h5 id="lights">Lights</h5>
<p>This choice of object is used to calculate the costs associated with electric lighting. Costs are entered on either a cost-per-each basis or as a cost-per-kilowatt-of-design-level. (This design level is an input in the Lights object.). The object name entered into the following field must match the name of a Zone object defined elsewhere in the input file.</p>
<h5 id="generatorphotovoltaic">Generator:Photovoltaic</h5>
<p>This choice of object is used to calculate the costs associated with a photovoltaic system. Costs are entered on a cost-per-kilowatt-of-rated-capacity. The rated capacity of a photovoltaic generator is calculated for cost modeling by exposing the surface to a 1000 W/m2 incident radiation using the area fraction and nominal fixed efficiency input by the user (from the Generator:Photovoltaic object). The object name entered into the following field must match the name of a Generator:Photovoltaic  object defined elsewhere in the input file.</p>

<h2 id="life-cycle-costing">Life-Cycle Costing</h2>
<p>Life-cycle costing is used with building energy simulation in order to justify energy efficiency upgrades. Many alterative building technologies that result in energy savings cost more initially, or may cost more to maintain, than traditional solutions. In order to justify selecting these energy savings technologies, it is essential to combine both initial and future costs in the decision process. Using life-cycle costs provides a framework to combine initial costs and future costs into a single combined measure, called the “present value.” Present value is a metric that combines all costs and reduces (or discounts) those costs that occur in the future. Discounting future costs is based on the principal of the time value of money.</p>
<p>The calculations are based on discounting the future values according to normal life-cycle costing techniques as described in NIST Handbook 135 “Life-Cycle Costing Manual for the Federal Energy Management Program.”</p>
<p>The following is a list of life-cycle costing related objects that provide a way to describe the parameters and costs associated with the life-cycle of a building or building system:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>LifeCycleCost:Parameters</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LifeCycleCost:RecurringCosts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LifeCycleCost:NonrecurringCost</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LifeCycleCost:UsePriceEscalation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LifeCycleCost:UseAdjustment</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The utility costs (see UtilityCost:Tariff) and first costs (see ComponentCost:LineItem) are  calculated by EnergyPlus are used along with other current and future costs input using the LifeCycleCost:RecurringCosts and LifeCycleCost:NonrecurringCost objects and these are combined these into the present value life-cycle cost metric. The LifeCycleCost:Parameters object establishes the set of assumptions for the analysis along with LifeCycleCost:UsePriceEscalation (often from a DataSet) and LifeCycleCost:UseAdjustment.</p>
<p>It is important to understand that the comparison of different simulation results and their present values is not performed by EnergyPlus. Instead, EnergyPlus provides the present value calculations for a specific simulation combining the energy costs, first costs, and future costs and you need to make the comparison between the results of multiple simulations.</p>
<p>The results of using the LifeCycleCost objects are included automatically in the tabular report file whenever the LifeCycleCost:Parameters object is present. The report appearing in the tabular report file is titled “Life Cycle Cost Report.” This report shows the costs and the timing of costs, often called “cash flows,” along with the present value in several different tables. The tabular results would show the present value of all current and future costs.</p>
<p>The datasets file “LCCusePriceEscalationDataSetXXXX.idf” includes the energy escalation factors from the NIST Handbook 135 annual supplement for the year indicated. These are necessary to use because the expected change in price for electricity and various fuels does not change at the same rate as inflation.</p>
<p>Life-cycle costing should not be confused with life-cycle analysis. With life-cycle costing the result is an economic evaluation of current and future expenditures in order to make a decision on alternative investments. In life cycle analysis, the environmental impact such as equivalent CO2 production involved in the materials, delivery, manufacturing, and construction are combined with environmental impacts of the building in operation and the eventual removal of the building and is used to understand the overall environmental impact or embodied energy.</p>
<h2 id="lifecyclecostparameters">LifeCycleCost:Parameters</h2>
<p>Provides inputs related to the overall life-cycle analysis. It establishes many of the assumptions used in computing the present value. It is important that when comparing the results of multiple simulations that the fields in the LifeCycleCost:Parameters objects are the same for all the simulations. To aide in this comparison, the first table in the Life-Cycle Cost Report shows the inputs to this object. Only one LifeCycleCost:Parameters object is permitted for a file. When this object is present the tabular report file will contain the Life-Cycle Cost Report.</p>
<h4 id="field-name_5">Field: Name</h4>
<p>An identifying name used for the LifeCycleCost:Parameters object.</p>
<h4 id="field-discounting-convention">Field: Discounting Convention</h4>
<p>The field specifies if the discounting of future costs should be computed as occurring at the end of each year, the middle of each year, or the beginning of each year. The most common discounting convention uses the end of each year. Without a specific reason, the end of each year should be used. Some military projects may specifically require using the middle of each year. The year being used starts with the base year and month and repeats every full year. All costs assumed to occur during that duration are accumulated and shown as an expense either at the beginning, middle or end of the year.  The options are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>BeginningOfYear</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MidYear</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EndOfYear</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="field-inflation-approach">Field: Inflation Approach</h4>
<p>This field is used to determine if the analysis should use constant dollars or current dollars which is related to how inflation is treated. The two options are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ConstantDollar</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CurrentDollar</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The default option is ConstantDollars</p>
<p>If ConstantDollar is selected, then the Real Discount Rate input is used and it excludes the rate of inflation. If CurrentDollar is selected, then the Nominal Discount Rate input is used and it includes the rate of inflation. From NIST Handbook 135:</p>
<p>“The constant dollar approach has the advantage of avoiding the need to project future rates of inflation or deflation. The price of a good or service stated in constant dollars is not affected by the rate of general inflation. For example, if the price of a piece of equipment is $1,000 today and $1,050 at the end of a year in which prices in general have risen at an annual rate of 5 percent, the price stated in constant dollars is still $1,000; no inflation adjustment is necessary. In contrast, if cash flows are stated in current dollars, future amounts include general inflation, and an adjustment is necessary to convert the current-dollar estimate to its constant-dollar equivalent. This adjustment is important because constant- and current-dollar amounts must not be combined in an LCCA [life cycle cost analysis].”</p>
<p>For most analyses, using the ConstantDollar option will be easier since the effect of inflation may be ignored.</p>
<h4 id="field-real-discount-rate">Field: Real Discount Rate</h4>
<p>Enter the real discount rate as a decimal. For a 3% rate, enter the value 0.03. This input is used when the Inflation Approach is ConstantDollar. The real discount rate reflects the interest rates needed to make current and future expenditures have comparable equivalent values when general inflation is ignored. When Inflation Approach is set to CurrentDollar this input is ignored. If this field is blank and Inflation Approach is ConstantDollar, a warning is issued.</p>
<h4 id="field-nominal-discount-rate">Field: Nominal Discount Rate</h4>
<p>Enter the nominal discount rate as a decimal. For a 5% rate, enter the value 0.05. This input is used when the Inflation Approach is CurrentDollar. The real discount rate reflects the interest rates needed to make current and future expenditures have comparable equivalent values when general inflation is included. When Inflation Approach is set to ConstantDollar this input is ignored. If this field is blank and Inflation Approach is CurrentDollar, a warning is issued.</p>
<h4 id="field-inflation-rate">Field: Inflation Rate</h4>
<p>Enter the rate of inflation for general goods and services as a decimal. For a 2% rate, enter the value 0.02. If this field is not blank and Inflation Approach is ConstantDollar, a warning is issued.</p>
<h4 id="field-base-date-month">Field: Base Date Month</h4>
<p>Enter the month that is the beginning of study period, also known as the beginning of the base period. According to NIST 135 “the base date is the point in time to which all project-related costs are discounted in an LCCA [life cycle cost analysis]. The base date is usually the first day of the study period for the project, which in turn is usually the date that the LCCA is performed. In a constant dollar analysis, the base date usually defines the time reference for the constant dollars (e.g. 1995 constant dollars). It is essential that you use the same base data and constant-dollar year for all of the project alternatives to be compared. If you set the base date to the date that the LCCA is performed, then the constant dollar basis for the analysis will be the current date, and you can use actual costs as of that date without adjusting for general inflation.”</p>

<p>The default value is January.</p>
<p>This field could also be referred to as part of “the date of study.” It is used as the date for constant dollars.</p>
<h4 id="field-base-date-year">Field: Base Date Year</h4>
<p>Enter the four digit year that is the beginning of study period, such as  a year expressed in four digits like “2013”. The study period is also known as the base period. See more details in the previous field.</p>
<h4 id="field-service-date-month">Field: Service Date Month</h4>
<p>Enter the month that is the beginning of building occupancy. Energy costs computed by EnergyPlus are assumed to occur during the year following the service date. The service date must be the same or later than the Base Date. The choices are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>January</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>February</p>

<p>December</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The default value is January. According to NIST Handbook 135:</p>
<p>“The service date is the date on which the project is expected to be implemented; operating and maintenance costs (including energy- and water-related costs) are generally incurred after this date, not before.”</p>
<p>This field could also be referred to as part of “beneficial occupancy date.”</p>
<h4 id="field-service-date-year">Field: Service Date Year</h4>
<p>Enter the four digit year that is the beginning of occupancy, such as  two years after the previously entered year expressed in four digits like “2013”. See more details in the previous field.</p>
<h4 id="field-length-of-study-period-in-years">Field: Length of Study Period in Years</h4>
<p>Enter the number of years of the study period. It is the number of years that the study continues based on the start at the base date. The default value is 25 years. Only integers may be used indicating whole years.  According to NIST Handbook 135, “the study period for an LCCA is the time over which the costs and benefits related to a capital investment decision are of interest to the decision maker. Thus, the study period begins with the base date and includes both the [planning/construction] period (if any) and the relevant service period for the project. The service period begins with the service date and extends to the end of the study period.”</p>
<h4 id="field-tax-rate">Field: Tax rate</h4>
<p>Enter the overall marginal tax rate for the project costs. This does not include energy or water taxes. The single tax rate entered here is not intended to be a replacement of the complex calculations necessary to compute personal or corporate taxes; instead it is an approximate that may be used for a simple analysis assuming a constant tax rate is applied on all costs. The tax rate entered should be based on the marginal tax rate for the entity and not the average tax rate. Enter the tax rate results in present value calculations after taxes. Most analyses do not factor in the impact of taxes and assume that all options under consideration have roughly the same tax impact. Due to this, many times the tax rate can be left to default to zero and the present value results before taxes are used to make decisions. The value should be entered as a decimal value. For 15% enter 0.15. For an analysis that does not include tax impacts, enter 0.0. The default is 0.</p>
<h4 id="field-depreciation-method">Field: Depreciation Method</h4>
<p>For an analysis that includes income tax impacts, this entry describes how capital costs are depreciated. According to IRS Publication 946 – How to Depreciate Property "Depreciation is an annual income tax deduction that allows you to recover the cost or other basis of certain property over the time you use the property. It is an allowance for Fair market value the wear and tear, deterioration, or obsolescence of the Intangible property.” Details on which depreciation method to choose depends on the property being depreciated and IRS Publication 946 and your accountant are the best sources of information in determining which depreciation method to choose. Only one depreciation method may be used for an analysis and is applied to all capital expenditures. Only analyses that include tax impacts need to select a depreciation method.</p>
<p>The options are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ModifiedAcceleratedCostRecoverySystem-3year</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ModifiedAcceleratedCostRecoverySystem-5year</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ModifiedAcceleratedCostRecoverySystem-7year</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ModifiedAcceleratedCostRecoverySystem-10year</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ModifiedAcceleratedCostRecoverySystem-15year</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ModifiedAcceleratedCostRecoverySystem-20year</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>StraightLine-27year</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>StraightLine-31year</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>StraightLine-39year</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>StraightLine-40year</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>None</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Depreciation allowances reduce the actual/nominal tax dollars paid by the owner.  Thus, analyses using depreciation should be conducted in nominal dollars. For an analysis that does not include tax effects, None should be selected.</p>
<p>The default value is None.</p>

<h2 id="lifecyclecostusepriceescalation">LifeCycleCost:UsePriceEscalation</h2>
<p>The LifeCycleCost:UsePriceEscalation object will commonly be part of a dataset on life cycle costs. The values for this object may be found in the annual supplement to NIST Handbook 135 in Tables Ca-1 to Ca-5. A dataset file comes with EnergyPlus in the DataSet directory and includes the LCCusePriceEscalationDataSetXXXX.idf file which includes the value for the supplement to NIST 135 from the year indicated. The object provides inputs for the escalations of energy and water costs assuming that they change differently than inflation. According to the NIST 135 supplement the values are “present projected fuel price indices for the four Census regions and for the United States. These indices, when multiplied by annual energy costs computed at base-date prices provide estimates of future-year costs in constant base-date dollars. Constant-dollar cost estimates are needed when discounting is performed with a real discount rate (i.e., a rate that does not include general price inflation).”</p>
<p>The LCCusePriceEscalationDataSetXXXX.idf is periodically updated by the EnergyPlus development team using data available from NIST along with a spreadsheet to convert that data into an IDF dataset file. The NIST 135 annual supplement is available from NIST or through US DOE FEMP program.</p>
<p>http://www1.eere.energy.gov/femp/program/lifecycle.html</p>
<p>If requested, NIST personnel will provide a file called ENCOSTxx.TXT which contains the data used to create Table Ca-1 to Table Ca-5 in the supplement. To convert the data in the ENCOSTxx.TXT file to an IDF file, open the ENCOSTxx.TXT file in a text editor and copy the entire contents into the first tab called “Step 1” of the conversion spreadsheet. The conversion spreadsheet file named ConvertENCOSTtoEnergyPlusLifeCycleCost.xls is available upon request from the EnergyPlus development team. The “Step 2” tab separates the data into columns. The “Step 3” tab computes ratios that are the same as Table Ca-1 to Table C1-6 in the supplement. Checking these values against what appears in the printed supplement is recommended. The “Step 4” and “Step 5” tabs rearrange the data and the “Step 6” tab shows the data in a format that can be easily copied and pasted into a new idf dataset file. The final step requires using your text editor to replace the fuel names with those used by EnergyPlus. The replacement names are listed on the “FuelNameConversion” tab.</p>

<p>The default value is January. According to NIST Handbook 135:</p>
<h4 id="field-year-1-escalation">Field: Year 1 Escalation</h4>
<p>The escalation in price of the energy or water use for the first year expressed as a decimal.</p>
<h4 id="field-year-n-escalation">Field: Year n Escalation</h4>
<p>The escalation in price of the energy or water use for the n-th year expressed as a decimal. This object is extensible and often includes 25 to 50 years of projected values.</p>
<p>If the number of years in LifeCycleCost:UsePriceEscalation is less than the number of years in the analysis period, the remaining years will assume no escalation. Normal inflation will be the only affect for these years.</p>

<h2 id="lifecyclecostuseadjustment">LifeCycleCost:UseAdjustment</h2>
<p>Used by advanced users to adjust the energy or water use costs for future years. This should not be used for compensating for inflation but should only be used to increase the costs of energy or water based on assumed changes to the actual use of water or energy, such as due to changes in the future function of the building or the impact of future adjacent buildings on energy use. This object is not commonly used and should be used with caution. The adjustments begin at the start of the service period.</p>
<h4 id="field-name_9">Field: Name</h4>
<p>The identifier used for the object.</p>
<h4 id="field-resource_1">Field: Resource</h4>
<p>Enter the resource such as:</p>

<h4 id="field-year-1-multiplier">Field: Year 1 multiplier</h4>
<p>The multiplier to be applied to the end use cost for the first year in the service period. The total utility costs for the selected end use is multiplied by this value. For no change enter 1.0.</p>
<h4 id="field-year-n-multiplier">Field: Year N multiplier</h4>
<p>The multiplier to be applied to the end use cost for each following year. The total utility costs for the selected end use is multiplied by this value. For no change enter 1.0.  This object is extensible and often includes 25 to 50 years of values.</p>

<h3 id="currencytype">CurrencyType</h3>
<p>By default, the predefined reports related to economics use the $ symbol. If a different symbol should be shown in the predefined reports to represent the local currency this object can be used. If the object is not used, the $ sign is used in the reports. Only one CurrencyType object is allowed in the input file.</p>
<h4 id="field-monetary-unit">Field: Monetary Unit</h4>
<p>The commonly used three letter currency code for the units of money for the country or region. Based on ISO 4217 currency codes.  Common currency codes are USD for the U.S. Dollar represented with ‘$’ and EUR for Euros represented with ‘€’.  The three letter currency codes can be seen at the following web sites (as of 2008):</p>
<p>http://www.iso.org/iso/support/faqs/faqs_widely_used_standards/widely_used_standards_other/currency_codes/currency_codes_list-1.htm</p>
<p>http://www.xe.com/symbols.php</p>
<p>When a three letter currency code is specified, the HTML file will use either an ASCII character if available or one or more UNICODE characters. Since not all browsers and all fonts used by browsers completely support UNICODE, not all currency symbols may be rendered correctly. If a box or a box with four small letters appears, this indicates that the browser and its fonts do not support a specific UNICODE character.</p>
<p>For text reports, an ASCII representation of the currency code will be used. Since ASCII is much more limited than UNICODE, many times the three letter currency code will be shown in the reports.</p>
<p>Since forms of currency change, please contact EnergyPlus support if a new currency code and symbol are needed.</p>
