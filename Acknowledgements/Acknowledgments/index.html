<p>The airflow calculation portion of the EnergyPlus AirflowNetwork model was based on AIRNET written by George Walton of the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), 100 Bureau Drive, Gaithersburg, MD 20899. The EnergyPlus AirflowNetwork model also includes portions of stack effect and detailed large opening from an early version of COMIS (Conjunction Of Multizone Infiltration Specialists) developed by a multinational, multi-institutional effort under the auspices of the International Energy Agency's Buildings and Community Systems Agreement working group focusing on multizone air flow modeling (Annex 23) and now administered by the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Testing and Research (EMPA), Division 175, Überlandstrasse 129, CH-8600 Dübendorf, Switzerland.</p>
<p>The EnergyPlus model for displacement ventilation and cross-ventilation (version v1.2 and later) was developed by Guilherme Carrilho da Graça (Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, University of California, San Diego and NaturalWorks) and Paul Linden (Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, University of California, San Diego).</p>
<p>The EnergyPlus models for UFAD served zones were developed by Anna Liu and Paul Linden at the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, University of California, San Diego.</p>
<p>ASHRAE research project 1254-RP supported the development of the following features first added in EnergyPlus v1.2.2: DXSystem:AirLoop enhancements (valid as OA system equipment, new humidity control options); New set point managers: SET POINT MANAGER:SINGLE ZONE HEATING, SET POINT MANAGER:SINGLE ZONE COOLING, and SET POINT MANAGER:OUTSIDE AIR PRETREAT; New 2-stage DX coil with enhanced dehumidification option (COIL:DX:MultiMode:CoolingEmpirical); Additional DESICCANT DEHUMIDIFIER:SOLID setpoint control option;  American Society of Heating Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Inc., 1791 Tullie Circle, N.E., Atlanta, GA 30329. <a href="http://www.ashrae.org/">www.ashrae.org/</a>. Work performed by GARD Analytics, Inc., 115 S. Wilke Road, Suite 105, Arlington Heights, IL, USA, &lt;info@gard.com&gt;, <a href="http://www.gard.com/">www.gard.com/</a>, November 2004. These items were renamed in V3.0 to SetpointManager:SingleZone:Heating, SetpointManager:SingleZone:Cooling, SetpointManager:OutdoorAirPretreat, Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoStageWithHumidityControlMode, Dehumidifier:Desiccant:NoFans, respectively.</p>
<p>The Ecoroof (Green Roof) model, first introduced in EnergyPlus v2.0, was developed at Portland State University, by David Sailor and his students. It is based on the FASST vegetation models developed by Frankenstein and Koenig for the US Army Corps of Engineers.</p>
<p>The HAMT (Heat And Moisture Transfer) model, first introduced in EnergyPlus v3.0.0 was developed by Phillip Biddulph, Complex Built Environment Systems, The Bartlett School of Graduate Studies, University College London, Gower Street, London WC1E 6BT, United Kingdom. <a href="http://www.cbes.ucl.ac.uk/">http://www.cbes.ucl.ac.uk/</a>.</p>
<p>The SQLite output module, first introduced in EnergyPlus v3.0.0, was developed by Gregory B. Stark, P.E., Building Synergies, LLC, 1860 Washington Street, Suite 208, Denver, Colorado 80203, United States.</p>
<p>Refrigeration compressor performance data and refrigeration practices were provided by CDH Energy, Cazenovia, NY 12035.</p>
<p>The external interface was developed by Michael Wetter and Philip Haves (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory) and by Rui Zhang (Carnegie Mellon University). An earlier upgrade to a development version of EnergyPlus 3.0 was implemented by Charles Corbin, Anthony Florita, Gregor Henze and Peter May-Ostendorp (University of Colorado at Boulder).</p>
<p>Various suggestions for time reduction, improved documentation and other items have been incorporated from Autodesk, Inc., Bentley Systems, and others.</p>
<p>Particular recognition goes to Noel Keen (LBNL Computational Research Division) and Geof Sawaya (Oak Ridge National Laboratory fellow) who have done extensive profiling and creation of time reduction features that have gone into the code.</p>
<p>Second Law modified the WaterToAirHeatPump:EquationFit module to include the variable “WaterCyclingMode”. This variable determines whether the heat pump water flow is constant, whether it cycles with the compressor, or whether it is constant when the heat pump is active. WaterFlowMode is set by the HVAC wrapper object; either ZoneHVAC:WaterToAirHeatPump or AirLoopHVAC:UnitaryHeatPump:WaterToAir. Second Law, Burlington, VT, Karen Walkerman.</p>

<p>The following notices apply to those EnergyPlus distributions which include the interface to BCVTB or Functional Mock-up Units.</p>
<h3 id="zlib-data-compression-library">ZLIB DATA COMPRESSION LIBRARY</h3>
<p>zlib 1.2.5 is a general purpose data compression library.  All the code is thread safe.  The data format used by the zlib library is described by RFCs (Request for Comments) 1950 to 1952 in the files http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1950.txt (zlib format), rfc1951.txt (deflate format) and rfc1952.txt (gzip format).</p>
<p>All functions of the compression library are documented in the file zlib.h (volunteer to write man pages welcome, contact zlib@gzip.org).  A usage example of the library is given in the file example.c which also tests that the library is working correctly.  Another example is given in the file minigzip.c.  The compression library itself is composed of all source files except example.c and minigzip.c.</p>
<p>To compile all files and run the test program, follow the instructions given at the top of Makefile.in.  In short "./configure; make test", and if that goes well, "make install" should work for most flavors of Unix.  For Windows, use one of the special makefiles in win32/ or contrib/vstudio/ .  For VMS, use make_vms.com.  Questions about zlib should be sent to &lt;zlib@gzip.org&gt;, or to Gilles Vollant &lt;info@winimage.com&gt; for the Windows DLL version.  The zlib home page is http://zlib.net/ .  Before reporting a problem, please check this site to verify that you have the latest version of zlib; otherwise get the latest version and check whether the problem still exists or not.</p>
<p>PLEASE read the zlib FAQ &gt;http://zlib.net/zlib_faq.html&lt; before asking for help.</p>
<p>Mark Nelson &lt;markn@ieee.org&gt; wrote an article about zlib for the Jan.  1997 issue of Dr.  Dobb's Journal; a copy of the article is available at &lt;http://marknelson.us/1997/01/01/zlib-engine/&gt; .</p>
<p>The changes made in version 1.2.5 are documented in the file ChangeLog.</p>
<p>Unsupported third party contributions are provided in directory contrib/ .</p>
<p>zlib is available in Java using the java.util.zip package, documented at &lt;http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/Programming/compression/&gt; .</p>
<p>A Perl interface to zlib written by Paul Marquess &lt;pmqs@cpan.org&gt; is available at CPAN (Comprehensive Perl Archive Network) sites, including &lt;http://search.cpan.org/~pmqs/IO-Compress-Zlib/&gt; .</p>
<p>A Python interface to zlib written by A.M. Kuchling &lt;amk@amk.ca&gt; is available in Python 1.5 and later versions, see &lt;http://www.python.org/doc/lib/module-zlib.html&gt;.</p>
<p>zlib is built into tcl: &lt;http://wiki.tcl.tk/4610&gt; .</p>
<p>An experimental package to read and write files in .zip format, written on top of zlib by Gilles Vollant &lt;info@winimage.com&gt;, is available in the contrib/minizip directory of zlib.</p>

<p>For 64-bit Irix, deflate.c must be compiled without any optimization. With -O, one libpng test fails. The test works in 32 bit mode (with the -n32   compiler flag). The compiler bug has been reported to SGI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>zlib doesn't work with gcc 2.6.3 on a DEC 3000/300LX under OSF/1 2.1 it works when compiled with cc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On Digital Unix 4.0D (formely OSF/1) on AlphaServer, the cc option -std1 is necessary to get gzprintf working correctly. This is done by configure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>zlib doesn't work on HP-UX 9.05 with some versions of /bin/cc. It works with other compilers. Use "make test" to check your compiler.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>gzdopen is not supported on RISCOS or BEOS.</p>

<p>The deflate format used by zlib was defined by Phil Katz.  The deflate and zlib specifications were written by L.  Peter Deutsch.  Thanks to all the people who reported problems and suggested various improvements in zlib; they are too numerous to cite here.</p>
