Input Changes version 22.1.0 to 22.2.0
=============

This file documents the structural changes on the input of EnergyPlus that could affect interfaces, etc.
This was previously an Excel workbook that made for very difficult version control, especially during busy times around code freezes.

# Object Change: FUELFACTORS

The second and third input parameters for the FuelFactors input syntax were eliminated because they were never used in the program.  Everything else that comes after it is simply shifted forward.

See: [FuelFactors: Units of Measures and Energy per Unit Factor are never used](https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/issues/9493)


# Object Change: Space

Summary: 2 new fields were added to the Space object.

Field 1-2 remain the same.
New Field 3 Ceiling Height, defaults to autocalculate
New Field 4 Volume, defaults to autocalculate
Remaining fields remain the same, shifted down by 2 places.

See [PR#9394](https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/pull/9394)

**For Coil:Cooling:WaterToAirHeatPump:EquationFit:**

The first ten fields remain the same, three new fields are then added for the rated temperatures. Default values are provided which corresponds to the value previously used.

See [PR #9439](https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/pull/9439)

**For Coil:Heating:WaterToAirHeatPump:EquationFit:**

The first nine fields remain the same, two new fields are then added for the rated temperatures and a new field that defines the ration of rated heating to cooling capacity is also added. Default values are provided which corresponds to the value previously used.
