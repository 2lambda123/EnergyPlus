Input Changes version 9.6.0 to 22.1.0
=============

This file documents the structural changes on the input of EnergyPlus that could affect interfaces, etc.
This was previously an Excel workbook that made for very difficult version control, especially during busy times around code freezes.

**For WindowProperty:FrameAndDivider:**

* No transition required. 
* Field name "NFRC Product Type for Assembly Calculations" was added to the end of the input object.

See pull request [#8740](https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/pull/8740) for more details.
