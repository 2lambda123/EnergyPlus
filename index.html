<h1>EnergyPlus Documentation</h1>

<p>The bulk of EnergyPlus documentation is no longer hosted on nrel.github.io.  EnergyPlus documentation is packaged up as pdfs with the installation, with those same pdfs being available for download online on the <a href="https://energyplus.net/documentation">EnergyPlus Documentation Page</a>.</p>

However, API documentation now lives on this gh-pages backed site.  Check out the <a href="https://nrel.github.io/EnergyPlus/api/index.html">API home page</a>.
